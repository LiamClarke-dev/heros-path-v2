/*
 * SOCIAL SCREEN (FUTURE SOCIAL FEATURES PLACEHOLDER)
 * ===================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This screen serves as a placeholder for future social features in Hero's Path.
 * It represents the planned social component that will allow users to share their
 * walking journeys, discoveries, and achievements with friends and the broader
 * Hero's Path community. Think of it as the "community hub" that will transform
 * Hero's Path from a personal walking app into a social exploration platform.
 * 
 * CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Placeholder Interface: Shows "Coming Soon" message to users
 * - Theme Integration: Consistent styling with current app theme
 * - Navigation Ready: Properly integrated with app navigation structure
 * - User Communication: Clear messaging about future feature availability
 * - Foundation Setup: Basic structure ready for social feature implementation
 * 
 * PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY (FUTURE DEVELOPMENT):
 * - Journey Sharing: Share walking routes and discoveries with friends
 * - Friend System: Connect with other Hero's Path users
 * - Discovery Feed: See what places friends have discovered
 * - Achievement Sharing: Share walking milestones and accomplishments
 * - Group Challenges: Participate in community walking challenges
 * - Place Recommendations: Get recommendations from friends and community
 * - Photo Sharing: Share photos from walks and discovered places
 * - Community Maps: Collaborative mapping of interesting walking areas
 * - Social Statistics: Compare walking progress with friends
 * - Event Planning: Organize group walks and exploration events
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Social features are increasingly important for user engagement and retention
 * in mobile apps. This placeholder reserves space in the app architecture for
 * future social functionality while clearly communicating to users that social
 * features are planned. It also allows the navigation structure to be complete
 * even while the features are under development.
 * 
 * FUTURE VISION:
 * - **Community Building**: Create a community of walking enthusiasts who share discoveries
 * - **Motivation**: Social features provide motivation through friendly competition
 * - **Discovery Enhancement**: Crowdsourced discovery recommendations improve exploration
 * - **Local Knowledge**: Users can share local knowledge about hidden gems and walking routes
 * - **Safety**: Group features and check-ins can enhance walking safety
 * - **Gamification**: Social challenges and achievements make walking more engaging
 * 
 * RELATIONSHIPS:
 * - Uses ThemeContext for consistent visual styling
 * - Integrated with App.js as part of the Drawer navigation
 * - Will connect to UserContext for profile and authentication features
 * - Will integrate with discovery and journey systems for content sharing
 * - Will use shared UI components for consistent interface design
 * - Future integration with push notifications for social interactions
 * 
 * REFERENCED BY:
 * - App.js (as part of the main Drawer navigation)
 * - Users exploring the app interface and discovering available features
 * - Future social features that will be built on this foundation
 * - Marketing and user onboarding to communicate planned functionality
 * 
 * REFERENCES:
 * - ThemeContext.js (for consistent styling)
 * - UI components (SectionHeader)
 * - Future: UserContext, DiscoveryService, JourneyService
 * - Future: Social media integration APIs
 * - Future: Push notification services
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APP:
 * LOW (CURRENT) / HIGH (FUTURE) - Currently just a placeholder, but social features
 * will be crucial for long-term user engagement and community building. Social
 * functionality can significantly increase user retention and app virality while
 * creating a competitive advantage over purely individual walking apps.
 *
