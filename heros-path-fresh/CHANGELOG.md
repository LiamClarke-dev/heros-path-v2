# Hero's Path App - Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 12 July 2025

### üöÄ **Major Features**

#### **Performance Optimization Complete**
- **Smart Caching**: Only make API calls for new journeys or when user explicitly refreshes
- **Existing Journey Detection**: Skip API calls when journey already has discoveries in Firestore
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh functionality for syncing UI state with database
- **Optimized Undo Operations**: Undo dismiss/save operations no longer trigger API calls
- **API Call Reduction**: ~95% reduction in API calls for journey reviews

#### **Real-Time Journey Status Tracking**
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Journey completion status updates immediately when discoveries change
- **Completion Percentage**: Tracks percentage of reviewed discoveries per journey
- **UI Status Indicators**: PastJourneysScreen shows "Review" vs "‚úÖ All Reviewed" status
- **Consistent Data**: Discovery records stay in sync with dismissed/saved collections

#### **Comprehensive Debug Logging System**
- **Centralized Logger**: `utils/Logger.js` provides consistent logging across the app
- **Multiple Log Levels**: Debug, Error, Warning, Info, Performance, API, Journey, Discovery, Cache
- **Easy Production Cleanup**: Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` to disable all debug logs
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in performance monitoring for key operations

#### **Improved Data Management & Deletion**
- **Comprehensive Journey Deletion**: Deletes journey and all associated data (discoveries, dismissed places)
- **Soft Delete Option**: Available for future implementation if needed
- **Development Utilities**: "Delete All Journeys" button for clean slate during development
- **No Orphaned Data**: Ensures complete cleanup when deleting journeys

### üîß **Technical Improvements**

#### **DiscoveryService.js**
- Added `updateJourneyCompletionStatus()` method for real-time status updates
- Enhanced `dismissPlace()` to update original discovery records
- Enhanced `undismissPlace()` to update original discovery records
- Added comprehensive logging for all operations
- Improved error handling and performance tracking

#### **DiscoveriesScreen.js**
- Modified `loadJourneyDiscoveries()` to check for existing discoveries before API calls
- Updated `onRefresh()` to only reload from Firestore, no API calls
- Fixed `handleUndoDismiss()` and `handleUndoSave()` to avoid API calls
- Added manual journey status updates after undo operations
- Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting

#### **JourneyService.js**
- Enhanced `deleteJourney()` with comprehensive cleanup of all associated data
- Added `deleteAllJourneys()` for development use
- Added soft delete methods for future implementation
- Updated `getUserJourneys()` to filter out soft-deleted journeys
- Added detailed logging for deletion operations

#### **NewPlacesService.js**

- Enhanced API call logging with duration tracking
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Added performance monitoring for API operations

#### **PastJourneysScreen.js**
- Updated to use Firestore completion status fields
- Added development "Delete All Journeys" button
- Enhanced journey status display with completion indicators
- Improved error handling and loading states

### üìÅ **New Files**

#### **utils/Logger.js**

- Easy production cleanup with single flag
- Comprehensive logging methods for all operations

#### **DEBUG_LOGGING_GUIDE.md**
- Complete documentation for the logging system
- Production cleanup checklist
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices and examples

### üìù **Updated Documentation**

#### **README.md**
- Updated to reflect latest performance optimizations
- Added current status and known issues
- Enhanced development workflow documentation
- Added production checklist

#### **DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md**
- Updated to show completion of performance optimization
- Added current focus areas and next priorities
- Enhanced technical implementation details
- Added performance metrics and monitoring

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**

#### **Data Consistency Issues**
- Fixed discovery records not staying in sync with dismissed/saved collections
- Fixed journey completion status not updating in real-time
- Fixed undo operations not showing restored places in suggestions list
- Fixed orphaned data when deleting journeys

#### **Performance Issues**
- Fixed excessive API calls when reviewing old journeys
- Fixed slow loading of journey completion status
- Fixed unnecessary API calls during undo operations
- Fixed performance degradation with multiple rapid operations

### üö® **Breaking Changes**

None - all changes are backward compatible.

### üîÑ **Migration Notes**

#### **For Existing Data**
- Existing journeys will work with new system
- Journey completion status will be calculated on first access
- No data migration required
- All existing discoveries and preferences preserved

#### **For Development**
- Debug mode is currently enabled (`DEBUG_MODE = true`)
- Development deletion button is active in PastJourneysScreen
- Comprehensive logging is active across all services
- Production cleanup required before deployment

### üìä **Performance Impact**

#### **API Call Optimization**
- **Before**: 18+ API calls per journey review
- **After**: 0 API calls for existing journeys, only for new journeys
- **Improvement**: ~95% reduction in API calls

#### **Load Time Improvements**
- **Old Journeys**: Instant loading from Firestore cache
- **Journey Status**: Real-time updates with no additional queries
- **Undo Operations**: Immediate response with no API calls
- **UI Responsiveness**: Instant feedback on all operations

### üõ† **Development Environment**

#### **Current Setup**
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled (`DEBUG_MODE = true` in `utils/Logger.js`)
- **Development Button**: "üóëÔ∏è DELETE ALL JOURNEYS (DEV)" available in PastJourneysScreen
- **Logging**: Comprehensive debug logs active across all services

#### **Production Preparation**
- Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` in `utils/Logger.js`
- Remove development deletion button from PastJourneysScreen
- Test all functionality with real data
- Monitor API usage and performance

### üéØ **Next Steps**

#### **High Priority**
1. **Route Discovery Algorithm**: Implement path-based search instead of center point
2. **Production Cleanup**: Remove debug logs and development utilities
3. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for API failures

#### **Medium Priority**
1. **Offline Mode**: Implement offline functionality with sync
2. **Journey Analytics**: Add insights and statistics
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add production performance tracking
