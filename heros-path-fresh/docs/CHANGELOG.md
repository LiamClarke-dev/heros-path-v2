# Hero's Path App - Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 12 July 2025

### üéØ **NEW: Ping Animation System & Credit System Fixes**

#### **Problem Solved**
The ping feature lacked visual feedback, and the credit system had corrupted data causing users to see incorrect credit counts (e.g., 63888002190 credits instead of 50).

#### **Solution Implemented**
- **Ping Animation System**: Added 4 different animation styles that trigger when ping button is pressed
- **Credit System Corruption Fix**: Automatic detection and recovery of corrupted credit data
- **Real-time Stats Updates**: PingStats component now updates in real-time
- **Animation Timing Fix**: Animations trigger immediately on button press, not after API completion

#### **Animation Options**
1. **üåä Ripple Effect**: Expanding circles with rotation (default)
2. **üí´ Pulse Wave**: Simple expanding pulse
3. **üîÑ Radar Sweep**: Rotating radar-like sweep
4. **‚ú® Particle Burst**: Particles exploding outward

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **PingAnimation.js**: New component with 4 animation types and configurable timing
- **AnimationDemo.js**: Demo component for testing different animation styles
- **Credit System Recovery**: Automatic detection of corrupted timestamp data
- **Real-time Updates**: 5-second refresh interval for PingStats

#### **User Experience Improvements**
- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Animation starts when button is pressed
- **No Popup Blocking**: Animation plays before success alert appears
- **Larger, Faster Animations**: More visible effects with reduced duration
- **Real-time Credit Display**: Shows actual current credits, not stale data

### üêõ **FIXED: Google Places API Issues**

#### **Problem Solved**
Google Places API calls were failing with parameter type errors and missing property access issues.

#### **Issues Fixed**
1. **Parameter Order Issue**: `searchNearbyPlaces` was called with incorrect parameter order
2. **Type Parameter Error**: Numbers were being passed as place types instead of strings
3. **Missing Property Access**: Code was trying to access `.url` property on error responses
4. **Firebase Storage Errors**: Undefined values in place data causing Firestore rejections

#### **Technical Fixes**
- **Parameter Validation**: Added number validation for coordinates and radius
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove undefined values before storing in Firestore
- **Error Handling**: Fixed catch blocks that referenced undefined variables
- **API Request Structure**: Corrected request body format for Google Places API v1

#### **Results**
- ‚úÖ **API calls successful**: All place types returning results
- ‚úÖ **No more API errors**: No more "Invalid value" or "Property 'url' doesn't exist" errors
- ‚úÖ **Data storage working**: No more Firebase storage errors
- ‚úÖ **Credit system working**: Proper credit decrementing (50 ‚Üí 49 ‚Üí 48, etc.)

### üêõ **FIXED: Logger Utility Missing Method**

#### **Problem Solved**
DiscoveriesScreen was calling `Logger.filter()` but the Logger utility didn't have this method, causing TypeError.

#### **Solution**
- **Added Missing Method**: Added `filter` method to Logger utility
- **Consistent Logging**: All Logger methods now available across the app

### üêõ **FIXED: Single-Point Journey Discovery Issues**

#### **Problem Solved**
Single-point journeys (testing at computer) were generating random global places instead of local discoveries.

#### **Root Cause**
- **SAR API Failure**: Search Along Route API fails with single-point routes
- **Fallback Issues**: Center-point fallback was using invalid coordinates
- **No Distance Validation**: System didn't check if route had meaningful distance

#### **Solution Implemented**
- **Minimum Distance Check**: Requires 50+ meters for 2-point routes
- **Single Point Blocking**: Prevents discoveries for single-point journeys
- **Coordinate Validation**: Validates center coordinates before API calls
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

#### **Technical Implementation**
```javascript
// Check if route has enough distance for meaningful discoveries
if (routeCoords.length < 3) {
  if (routeCoords.length === 2) {
    const distance = calculateDistance(routeCoords[0], routeCoords[1]);
    if (distance < 50) return []; // Less than 50 meters
  } else {
    return []; // Single point route
  }
}
```

#### **Results**
- ‚úÖ **No more random places**: Single-point journeys return empty results
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging**: Detailed logs show distance calculations
- ‚úÖ **Proper validation**: Invalid coordinates are caught and logged
- ‚úÖ **Real testing required**: Users must actually walk for discoveries

### üöÄ **NEW: Location Permission Warning System**

#### **Problem Solved**
Users were not seeing location permission prompts when needed, and those with "While Using" permission weren't aware that their journey data could be inaccurate when the app was minimized or screen was locked.

#### **Solution Implemented**
- **Automatic Permission Requests**: Location permission prompts now appear when needed during app initialization and location requests
- **Background Permission Warning**: Banner appears when user has "While Using" instead of "Always" permission
- **Dynamic Permission Checking**: Banner automatically disappears when user grants "Always" permission
- **User-Friendly Alerts**: Clear explanations of permission requirements and privacy implications

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **BackgroundLocationService.js**: Enhanced with automatic permission requests and user-friendly error messages
- **MapScreen.js**: Added permission warning banner with dynamic visibility
- **Permission Flow**: Check ‚Üí Request ‚Üí Warn ‚Üí Re-check on focus
- **Settings Integration**: Direct link to device settings for permission management

#### **User Experience Improvements**
- **Clear Communication**: Banner text: "Hero's Path Does Not Have 'Always' Allow Location Access (Tap to resolve)"
- **Privacy Transparency**: Explains exactly when location is tracked and what data is collected
- **Easy Resolution**: One-tap access to device settings with clear navigation instructions
- **Automatic Updates**: Banner disappears immediately when permission is granted

#### **Privacy Features**
- **Transparent Messaging**: Clear explanation that location is only tracked during active walks
- **No Real-time Monitoring**: Emphasizes that developers cannot see location in real-time
- **User Control**: Easy access to change permissions at any time
- **Informed Consent**: Users understand exactly what permissions are needed and why

### üöÄ **NEW: Search Along Route (SAR) Implementation Plan**

#### **Problem Solved**
The route discovery algorithm was using `calculateRouteCenter()` which averaged GPS coordinates to find a single center point, fundamentally breaking the app's core value proposition of discovering places along the entire walking route.

#### **New Solution: Google Places API SAR**
**Phase 1: End-of-Trip "Search Along Route" (High Priority)**
- **Single API Call**: Use `places:searchText` with `searchAlongRouteParameters`
- **Full Path Coverage**: Searches along ENTIRE route, not just center point
- **No Detour Bias**: Uses actual walking path via encoded polyline
- **Minimal API Cost**: 1 call instead of 5-10 segment calls
- **Google Optimized**: Leverages Google's built-in path-based search

**Phase 2: Real-Time "Ping" Feature (Medium Priority)**
- **On-Demand Discovery**: User can ping for nearby places during active walks
- **Controlled Usage**: 10-second cooldown and monthly credit limits
- **Real-time Results**: Immediate feedback with animated markers
- **Hybrid Storage**: Combines ping results with end-of-trip SAR results

#### **Technical Implementation**
```javascript
// New SAR approach in services/DiscoveriesService.js
{
  "textQuery": "restaurant cafe park",
  "searchAlongRouteParameters": {
    "polyline": { "encodedPolyline": "..." }
  }
}
```

#### **Expected Benefits**
- **API Efficiency**: ~80% reduction in API calls for route discovery
- **Full Route Coverage**: Discovers places along entire walking path
- **Better User Experience**: No more missed discoveries at route extremities
- **Real-time Engagement**: Ping feature keeps users engaged during walks

#### **Implementation Timeline**
- **Immediate**: Replace center-point algorithm with SAR
- **Next Sprint**: Add ping feature and credit system
- **Future**: Route optimization and advanced filtering
