```

**Check for:**
- [ ] Drawer ‚Üí Stack ‚Üí Tab structure is correct
- [ ] All screen names match their file names
- [ ] Navigation parameters are properly typed
- [ ] No circular dependencies

#### **1.2 Screen Dependencies Check**
```bash

git diff --cached --name-only
```

**Check for:**
- [ ] Current branch is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] All feature branches are listed
- [ ] No orphaned or stale branches
- [ ] Branch naming follows conventions

#### **7.2 Feature Branch Review**

# Check branch divergence from main
git log --oneline main..feature/branch-name
```

**For each feature branch, verify:**

```

**Identify:**
- Merged branches that can be deleted
- Stale branches that should be cleaned up
- Branches that need attention before deletion

### **Expected Output**
- List of feature branches and their status
