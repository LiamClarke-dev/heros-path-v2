# New Developer Onboarding Checklist

**Welcome to Hero's Path!** üéÆ

This checklist will help you get up to speed quickly and ensure you follow our established processes.

---

## **üöÄ Quick Start (30 minutes)**

### **1. Environment Setup**
- [ ] Clone the repository: `git clone [repo-url]`
- [ ] Navigate to project: `cd heros-path-fresh`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Verify setup: `npx expo start --clear`

### **2. Documentation Review**
- [ ] Read `README.md` - Project overview and current status
- [ ] Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` - Known issues and priorities
- [ ] Read `docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md` - Previous audit findings
- [ ] Read `docs/AUDIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Complete audit process

### **3. Current Project Status**
- [ ] Check current branch: `git branch`
- [ ] Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -10`
- [ ] Check for any uncommitted changes: `git status`

## **üîç First Task: Code Audit**

### **Why Audit First?**
- Ensures you understand the codebase structure
- Identifies any issues that need attention
- Provides context for future development
- Follows our established quality process

### **Audit Process**
1. **Follow the workflow**: Use `docs/AUDIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`
2. **Track progress**: Update `docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`
3. **Document findings**: Use the standardized issue format
4. **Prioritize fixes**: Address critical issues first

### **Expected Timeline**
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 hours (Navigation & Services)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 hours (UI & Screens)
- **Phase 5-6**: 1-2 hours (Config & Performance)
- **Phase 7**: 30-60 minutes (GitHub Branch Audit)
- **Total**: 6-9 hours for complete audit

### **GitHub Branch Audit Focus**
The new Phase 7 specifically covers:
- **Branch status analysis**: Check for uncommitted changes and branch health
- **Feature branch review**: Identify stale branches and integration readiness
- **Code quality check**: Review commit messages and untracked files
- **Integration readiness**: Test merge compatibility with main
- **Cleanup recommendations**: Identify branches that can be deleted

## **üìã Development Guidelines**

### **Code Standards**
- Use React Native components and styling
- Follow the existing theme system in `styles/theme.js`
- Use the `useTheme()` hook for dynamic theming
- Place UI components in `components/` directory
- Use existing color variables from the theme system

### **Git Workflow**
- Create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Push regularly: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
- Create pull requests for review

### **Testing Strategy**
- Use Expo Go for JavaScript logic and UI changes
- Build development version for native dependencies
- Test on both iOS and Android when possible

---

## **üéØ Current Priorities**

### **High Priority**
- Review and address any remaining audit findings
- Ensure theme system is fully integrated
- Verify API key management is secure
- Check for performance bottlenecks

### **Medium Priority**
- Implement route discovery algorithm improvements
- Add missing accessibility features
- Optimize bundle size
- Enhance error handling

### **Low Priority**
- Add new UI themes
- Implement additional map styles
- Add new discovery features
- Performance optimizations

---

## **üÜò Getting Help**

### **Documentation Resources**
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Recent changes and updates
- `docs/API/` - API integration guides
- `docs/PLATFORM/` - Platform-specific issues

### **Key Files to Know**
- `App.js` - Main app entry point
- `navigation/AppNavigator.js` - Navigation structure
- `styles/theme.js` - Theme system
- `services/` - API and data services
- `screens/` - Main app screens
- `components/` - Reusable UI components

### **Common Issues**
- **API Keys**: Never hardcode, use environment variables
- **Theme Integration**: Always use `useTheme()` hook
- **Navigation**: Check parameter passing between screens
- **Performance**: Monitor API calls and memory usage
