# Hero's Path App - Development Status

# Next Priorities

## 1. Ping Animation Overhaul (Future Enhancement)
- Redesign the ping animation to feel like a "special power" charge and release.
- Animation should last 3‚Äì5 seconds, with a dramatic, screen-dominating effect.
- Should include a "charging up" phase (inward pulse/glow), then a powerful outward ripple.
- Consider future addition of vibration and sound for extra feedback.
- **Note**: Currently disabled with scaffolding in place for future implementation
- See user notes for vision:
  - Gamified, impactful, not subtle
  - User should feel like they're charging and releasing energy
  - (Future) Add vibration on release

## 2. React Native Warning: useInsertionEffect must not schedule updates
- Terminal log:
  - `ERROR  Warning: useInsertionEffect must not schedule updates.`
  - Call Stack: DrawerNavigator, RNSScreenContainer, RNCSafeAreaProvider, MainStackScreen, Root, App
- This warning appears in the terminal and should be investigated and resolved.

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Ping Animation System & Critical Bug Fixes**

### üéØ **Ping Animation System**
**Problem Solved**: The ping feature lacked visual feedback, making it unclear when the feature was working.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **4 Animation Styles**: Ripple, Pulse, Radar, and Particle effects
- **Immediate Feedback**: Animations trigger on button press, not after API completion
- **Configurable Timing**: Faster, more visible animations with reduced duration
- **Non-Intrusive**: Uses `pointerEvents="none"` to avoid interfering with map interaction

**Technical Implementation**:
- **PingAnimation.js**: New component with 4 animation types and configurable timing
- **AnimationDemo.js**: Demo component for testing different animation styles
- **MapScreen Integration**: Animation positioned at Link sprite location
- **Real-time Updates**: 5-second refresh interval for PingStats

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Animation starts when button is pressed
- **No Popup Blocking**: Animation plays before success alert appears
- **Larger, Faster Animations**: More visible effects with reduced duration
- **Real-time Credit Display**: Shows actual current credits, not stale data

### üêõ **Google Places API Issues Fixed**
**Problem Solved**: Google Places API calls were failing with parameter type errors and missing property access issues.

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Parameter Order Issue**: `searchNearbyPlaces` was called with incorrect parameter order
2. **Type Parameter Error**: Numbers were being passed as place types instead of strings
3. **Missing Property Access**: Code was trying to access `.url` property on error responses
4. **Firebase Storage Errors**: Undefined values in place data causing Firestore rejections

**Technical Fixes**:
- **Parameter Validation**: Added number validation for coordinates and radius
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove undefined values before storing in Firestore
- **Error Handling**: Fixed catch blocks that referenced undefined variables
- **API Request Structure**: Corrected request body format for Google Places API v1

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **API calls successful**: All place types returning results
- ‚úÖ **No more API errors**: No more "Invalid value" or "Property 'url' doesn't exist" errors
- ‚úÖ **Data storage working**: No more Firebase storage errors
- ‚úÖ **Credit system working**: Proper credit decrementing (50 ‚Üí 49 ‚Üí 48, etc.)

### üêõ **Credit System Corruption Fix**
**Problem Solved**: Credit system had corrupted data causing users to see incorrect credit counts (e.g., 63888002190 credits instead of 50).

**Root Cause**: The original code was setting `creditsRemaining: serverTimestamp()` which created Firestore timestamps instead of numbers.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Corruption Detection**: Automatically detects when credits are stored as Firestore timestamps
- **Automatic Recovery**: Resets corrupted data to default values (50 credits, 0 pings used)
- **Prevention**: Ensures all future updates use proper numbers
- **Real-time Updates**: PingStats component updates every 5 seconds

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Corrupted data detected and fixed**: Automatic recovery working
- ‚úÖ **Proper credit tracking**: Shows correct values (50 ‚Üí 49 ‚Üí 48, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates**: Stats refresh automatically
- ‚úÖ **No more corruption**: All future updates use proper numbers

### üêõ **Single-Point Journey Discovery Issues Fixed**
**Problem Solved**: Single-point journeys (testing at computer) were generating random global places instead of local discoveries.

**Root Cause**:
- **SAR API Failure**: Search Along Route API fails with single-point routes
- **Fallback Issues**: Center-point fallback was using invalid coordinates
- **No Distance Validation**: System didn't check if route had meaningful distance

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Minimum Distance Check**: Requires 50+ meters for 2-point routes
- **Single Point Blocking**: Prevents discoveries for single-point journeys
- **Coordinate Validation**: Validates center coordinates before API calls
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Check if route has enough distance for meaningful discoveries
if (routeCoords.length < 3) {
  if (routeCoords.length === 2) {
    const distance = calculateDistance(routeCoords[0], routeCoords[1]);
    if (distance < 50) return []; // Less than 50 meters
  } else {
    return []; // Single point route
  }
}
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **No more random places**: Single-point journeys return empty results
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging**: Detailed logs show distance calculations
- ‚úÖ **Proper validation**: Invalid coordinates are caught and logged
- ‚úÖ **Real testing required**: Users must actually walk for discoveries

### üêõ **Logger Utility Missing Method Fixed**
**Problem Solved**: DiscoveriesScreen was calling `Logger.filter()` but the Logger utility didn't have this method, causing TypeError.

**Solution**:
- **Added Missing Method**: Added `filter` method to Logger utility
- **Consistent Logging**: All Logger methods now available across the app

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **No more TypeError**: DiscoveriesScreen loads without errors
- ‚úÖ **Consistent logging**: All Logger methods available

## üö® **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Route Discovery Algorithm - NEW SOLUTION**

### **Problem Solved: Search Along Route (SAR) Implementation**

**Previous Problem**: The route discovery algorithm used `calculateRouteCenter()` which averaged GPS coordinates to find a single center point, fundamentally breaking the app's core value proposition.

**New Solution**: Implement Google Places API's **Search Along Route (SAR)** feature with optional real-time "Ping" functionality.

### **üéØ SAR Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: End-of-Trip "Search Along Route" (High Priority)**
**When**: User taps "End Walk"
**Backend Process**:
1. Receive full GPS trace in single request
2. Convert to encoded polyline
3. Call Places Text Search once with `searchAlongRouteParameters`
4. Filter by user preferences, dedupe by place_id
5. Persist to Firestore under `trips/{tripId}.discoveries`

**API Call Structure**:
```javascript
{
  "textQuery": "restaurant cafe park",
  "searchAlongRouteParameters": {
    "polyline": { "encodedPolyline": "..." }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Single API Call**: Instead of multiple segment calls
- ‚úÖ **Full Path Coverage**: Searches along ENTIRE route, not just center point
- ‚úÖ **No Detour Bias**: Uses actual walking path
- ‚úÖ **Minimal API Cost**: 1 call instead of 5-10 segment calls
- ‚úÖ **Google Optimized**: Leverages Google's built-in path-based search

#### **Phase 2: Real-Time "Ping" Feature (Medium Priority)**
**When**: User taps "Ping" during active walk
**Rules**:
- 10 second cooldown per user
- Monthly credit limit
- 500m radius search around current location

**Implementation**:
- Endpoint: `POST /users/{uid}/ping`
- Validate cooldown & remaining credits
- Run nearby search around current lat/lng
- Store results in `trips/{tripId}/discoveries` subcollection
- Decrement credit, update last-ping timestamp

**UI Features**:
- "Ping" button with cooldown timer and credit counter
- Spinner/overlay while loading
- Animated markers for returned POIs
- Toast notifications for cooldown/credit limits

### **üìä Expected Impact**

#### **Performance Improvements**
- **API Efficiency**: ~80% reduction in API calls for route discovery
- **Response Time**: Faster due to single optimized call
- **Cost Reduction**: Significant reduction in Google Places API usage
- **Reliability**: Less chance of API failures

#### **User Experience Improvements**
- **Full Route Coverage**: Discovers places along entire walking path
- **Real-time Discovery**: Ping feature for immediate feedback during walks
- **Better Results**: No more missed discoveries at route extremities
- **Engagement**: Keeps users engaged during longer walks

### **üîß Technical Implementation**

#### **Files to Modify**
- **`services/DiscoveriesService.js`**: Replace `calculateRouteCenter()` with SAR implementation
- **`services/PingService.js`**: New service for real-time discovery
- **`screens/MapScreen.js`**: Add ping button during active walks
- **Firestore Structure**: Add subcollections for ping results

#### **New Service Structure**
```javascript
// services/DiscoveriesService.js
async function getSuggestionsForRoute(routeCoordinates, preferences) {
  const encodedPolyline = encodePolyline(routeCoordinates);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${NEW_BASE_URL}/places:searchText`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-Goog-Api-Key': apiKey,
      'X-Goog-FieldMask': 'places.id,places.displayName,places.types,places.rating,places.location,places.formattedAddress'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      textQuery: buildSearchQuery(preferences),
      searchAlongRouteParameters: {
        polyline: { encodedPolyline }
      },
      maxResultCount: 50
    })
  });
  
  return processAndFilterResults(response.data.places, preferences);
}
```
