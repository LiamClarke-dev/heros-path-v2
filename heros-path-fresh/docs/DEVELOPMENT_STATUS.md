- **Impact**: 
  - Android devices would use wrong iOS API keys, causing API failures
  - Undefined keys would result in "key=undefined" in API URLs
  - All photo URLs and API requests could fail on Android or when keys undefined
- **Files Fixed (6 total)**:
  - **Screens (3)**: `DiscoveriesScreen.js`, `SavedPlacesScreen.js`, `DiscoveriesScreen_old.js`
  - **Services (3)**: `NewPlacesService.js`, `EnhancedPlacesService.js`, `DiscoveriesService.js`
- **Solution**: Proper platform-specific API key selection using `Platform.OS`
- **Implementation**: Added `getPlacesAPIKey()` helpers with fallback handling
- **Result**: ‚úÖ API keys now correctly selected per platform with proper error handling

## 14 July 2025 ‚Äî Service Layer Documentation & Audit

- Service documentation complete: All files in `/services/` now have top-of-file JSDoc comments describing their role and interactions.
- Service boundaries clarified: No redundant or confusing overlap remains; each service‚Äôs responsibility is explicit.
- DiscoveryConsolidationService: Retained as a dedicated utility for merging SAR and cached discoveries after a trip or ping event.
- Next developer: Can quickly understand and extend the service layer thanks to improved documentation and clear separation of concerns.

# Next Priorities

## 1. Ping Animation Overhaul (Future Enhancement)
- Redesign the ping animation to feel like a "special power" charge and release.
- Animation should last 3‚Äì5 seconds, with a dramatic, screen-dominating effect.
- Should include a "charging up" phase (inward pulse/glow), then a powerful outward ripple.
- Consider future addition of vibration and sound for extra feedback.
- **Note**: Currently disabled with scaffolding in place for future implementation
- See user notes for vision:
  - Gamified, impactful, not subtle
  - User should feel like they're charging and releasing energy
  - (Future) Add vibration on release

## 2. React Native Warning: useInsertionEffect must not schedule updates
- Terminal log:
  - `ERROR  Warning: useInsertionEffect must not schedule updates.`
  - Call Stack: DrawerNavigator, RNSScreenContainer, RNCSafeAreaProvider, MainStackScreen, Root, App
- This warning appears in the terminal and should be investigated and resolved.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **4 Animation Styles**: Ripple, Pulse, Radar, and Particle effects
- **Immediate Feedback**: Animations trigger on button press, not after API completion
- **Configurable Timing**: Faster, more visible animations with reduced duration
- **Non-Intrusive**: Uses `pointerEvents="none"` to avoid interfering with map interaction

**Technical Implementation**:
- **PingAnimation.js**: New component with 4 animation types and configurable timing
- **AnimationDemo.js**: Demo component for testing different animation styles
- **MapScreen Integration**: Animation positioned at Link sprite location
- **Real-time Updates**: 5-second refresh interval for PingStats

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Animation starts when button is pressed
- **No Popup Blocking**: Animation plays before success alert appears
- **Larger, Faster Animations**: More visible effects with reduced duration
- **Real-time Credit Display**: Shows actual current credits, not stale data

### üêõ **Google Places API Issues Fixed**
**Problem Solved**: Google Places API calls were failing with parameter type errors and missing property access issues.

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Parameter Order Issue**: `searchNearbyPlaces` was called with incorrect parameter order
2. **Type Parameter Error**: Numbers were being passed as place types instead of strings
3. **Missing Property Access**: Code was trying to access `.url` property on error responses
4. **Firebase Storage Errors**: Undefined values in place data causing Firestore rejections

**Technical Fixes**:
- **Parameter Validation**: Added number validation for coordinates and radius
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove undefined values before storing in Firestore
- **Error Handling**: Fixed catch blocks that referenced undefined variables
- **API Request Structure**: Corrected request body format for Google Places API v1

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **API calls successful**: All place types returning results
- ‚úÖ **No more API errors**: No more "Invalid value" or "Property 'url' doesn't exist" errors
- ‚úÖ **Data storage working**: No more Firebase storage errors
- ‚úÖ **Credit system working**: Proper credit decrementing (50 ‚Üí 49 ‚Üí 48, etc.)

### üêõ **Credit System Corruption Fix**
**Problem Solved**: Credit system had corrupted data causing users to see incorrect credit counts (e.g., 63888002190 credits instead of 50).

**Root Cause**: The original code was setting `creditsRemaining: serverTimestamp()` which created Firestore timestamps instead of numbers.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Corruption Detection**: Automatically detects when credits are stored as Firestore timestamps
- **Automatic Recovery**: Resets corrupted data to default values (50 credits, 0 pings used)
- **Prevention**: Ensures all future updates use proper numbers
- **Real-time Updates**: PingStats component updates every 5 seconds

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Corrupted data detected and fixed**: Automatic recovery working
- ‚úÖ **Proper credit tracking**: Shows correct values (50 ‚Üí 49 ‚Üí 48, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates**: Stats refresh automatically
- ‚úÖ **No more corruption**: All future updates use proper numbers

### üêõ **Single-Point Journey Discovery Issues Fixed**
**Problem Solved**: Single-point journeys (testing at computer) were generating random global places instead of local discoveries.

**Root Cause**:
- **SAR API Failure**: Search Along Route API fails with single-point routes
- **Fallback Issues**: Center-point fallback was using invalid coordinates
- **No Distance Validation**: System didn't check if route had meaningful distance

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Minimum Distance Check**: Requires 50+ meters for 2-point routes
- **Single Point Blocking**: Prevents discoveries for single-point journeys
- **Coordinate Validation**: Validates center coordinates before API calls
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Check if route has enough distance for meaningful discoveries
if (routeCoords.length < 3) {
  if (routeCoords.length === 2) {
    const distance = calculateDistance(routeCoords[0], routeCoords[1]);
    if (distance < 50) return []; // Less than 50 meters
  } else {
    return []; // Single point route
  }
}
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **No more random places**: Single-point journeys return empty results
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging**: Detailed logs show distance calculations
- ‚úÖ **Proper validation**: Invalid coordinates are caught and logged
- ‚úÖ **Real testing required**: Users must actually walk for discoveries

### üêõ **Logger Utility Missing Method Fixed**
**Problem Solved**: DiscoveriesScreen was calling `Logger.filter()` but the Logger utility didn't have this method, causing TypeError.

**Solution**:
- **Added Missing Method**: Added `filter` method to Logger utility
- **Consistent Logging**: All Logger methods now available across the app

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **No more TypeError**: DiscoveriesScreen loads without errors
- ‚úÖ **Consistent logging**: All Logger methods available

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Route Discovery Algorithm (SAR) Implementation**

### **Problem Solved: Search Along Route (SAR) Implementation**

**Previous Problem**: The route discovery algorithm used `calculateRouteCenter()` which averaged GPS coordinates to find a single center point, fundamentally breaking the app's core value proposition.

**Solution Implemented**: Google Places API's **Search Along Route (SAR)** feature with optional real-time "Ping" functionality.

### **üéØ SAR Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

#### **‚úÖ Phase 1: End-of-Trip "Search Along Route" - COMPLETED**
**When**: User taps "End Walk"
**Backend Process**:
1. ‚úÖ Receive full GPS trace in single request
2. ‚úÖ Convert to encoded polyline
3. ‚úÖ Call Places Text Search once with `searchAlongRouteParameters`
4. ‚úÖ Filter by user preferences, dedupe by place_id
5. ‚úÖ Persist to Firestore under `journeys/{userId}/discoveries`

**API Call Structure**:
```javascript
{
  "textQuery": "restaurant cafe park",
  "searchAlongRouteParameters": {
    "polyline": { "encodedPolyline": "..." }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Single API Call**: Instead of multiple segment calls
- ‚úÖ **Full Path Coverage**: Searches along ENTIRE route, not just center point
- ‚úÖ **No Detour Bias**: Uses actual walking path
- ‚úÖ **Minimal API Cost**: 1 call instead of 5-10 segment calls
- ‚úÖ **Google Optimized**: Leverages Google's built-in path-based search

#### **‚úÖ Phase 2: Real-Time "Ping" Feature - COMPLETED**
**When**: User taps "Ping" during active walk
**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ 10 second cooldown per user
- ‚úÖ Monthly credit limit (50 credits)
- ‚úÖ 500m radius search around current location

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Endpoint: `POST /users/{uid}/ping`
- ‚úÖ Validate cooldown & remaining credits
- ‚úÖ Run nearby search around current lat/lng
- ‚úÖ Store results in `journeys/{userId}/pingResults` subcollection
- ‚úÖ Decrement credit, update last-ping timestamp

**UI Features**:
- ‚úÖ "Ping" button with cooldown timer and credit counter
- ‚úÖ Spinner/overlay while loading

  const encodedPolyline = encodePolyline(routeCoordinates);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${NEW_BASE_URL}/places:searchText`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-Goog-Api-Key': apiKey,
      'X-Goog-FieldMask': 'places.id,places.displayName,places.types,places.rating,places.location,places.formattedAddress'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      textQuery: buildSearchQuery(preferences),
      searchAlongRouteParameters: {
        polyline: { encodedPolyline }
      },
      maxResultCount: 50
    })
  });
  
  return processAndFilterResults(response.data.places, preferences);

# UI/UX and Navigation Refactor Plan (July 2025)

## Navigation Structure
- Move to a scalable navigation structure: DrawerNavigator for top-level, StackNavigator for flows, TabNavigator for sub-sections.
- Example: Drawer (Map, Social, Settings, etc.), each with its own Stack, and Tabs for sub-sections (e.g., Discoveries).

## Shared UI Components
- Create a `components/ui/` directory for Card, ListItem, AppButton, SectionHeader, Divider, etc.
- Use these across all screens for a unified look.

## Card-Based Layouts
- All screens should use card-based layouts for lists and detail views.
- Consistent padding, spacing, and section headers.

## Theming
- Use the theme system for all backgrounds, borders, text, and shadows.
- Pass theme colors as props to shared components.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored SettingsScreen to use SectionCard and SettingsButton for a modern, consistent look.
- Forced Google Maps provider on iOS for custom map styles and consistency.
- Plan to refactor all screens to use shared UI components and card-based layouts.

## Next Steps
1. Create shared UI components in `components/ui/`.
2. Refactor PastJourneysScreen and other screens to use these components.
3. Move navigation logic to a `navigation/` directory and split into logical stacks.
4. Adopt card-based, sectioned layout across all screens.
5. Use the theme system for all colors, spacing, and typography.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (14 July 2025)
- **Apple Maps/Google Maps Fallback:**
  - On iOS, if the Google Maps API key is missing or not injected, the app falls back to Apple Maps (MapKit). This is a temporary workaround; Google Maps integration is preferred and should be fixed in a future sprint.
  - The Google Maps API key is confirmed present in EAS, but is not being injected at runtime. This prevents Google Maps tiles from loading, resulting in no map background.
- **Link Sprite Rendering Bug:**
  - The animated Link sprite (GIF) appears as a white silhouette on iOS. This is likely due to iOS not supporting animated GIFs natively in React Native's <Image /> component.
  - As a workaround, a static PNG can be used for iOS, or a library such as react-native-fast-image or a sprite sheet animation should be considered for future support.
