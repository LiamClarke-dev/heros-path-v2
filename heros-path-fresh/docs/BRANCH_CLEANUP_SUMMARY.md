# Branch Cleanup Summary

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Task:** Comprehensive GitHub Branch Cleanup

## Overview

Successfully cleaned up a complex branch situation with multiple overlapping cursor-generated branches and diverged main branches.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Synchronization
- ✅ Reset local `main` to match `origin/main` (authoritative source)
- ✅ Resolved divergence between local and remote main branches
- ✅ Fetched latest changes from remote

### 2. Important Work Preservation
- ✅ **Created clean branch**: `feature/gps-tracking-improvements`
- ✅ **Cherry-picked critical GPS fixes**: 
  - `de34757` - fix(mapscreen): add missing locationAccuracy state variable
  - Contains important GPS tracking improvements and bug fixes
- ✅ **Pushed to remote** for PR creation: https://github.com/LiamClarke-dev/heros-path-v2/pull/new/feature/gps-tracking-improvements

- ✅ `feature/gps-tracking-improvements` - Ready for PR

### Remote Branches (Preserved):
- `origin/cursor/export-components-and-themes-to-figma-01c7` - Figma integration
- `origin/cursor/fix-background-gps-tracking-and-route-accuracy-99f3` - GPS fixes

## Statistics

### Before Cleanup:
- **Local branches:** 8 (including many overlapping cursor branches)
- **Remote branches:** 16
- **Status:** Confusing, overlapping work, diverged main

### After Cleanup:
- **Local branches:** 1 (main)
- **Remote branches:** 11
- **Status:** Clean, organized, important work preserved

## Next Steps

1. **Create PR** for `feature/gps-tracking-improvements` using the provided GitHub link
2. **Review remaining remote branches** to determine if any contain unique work worth preserving
3. **Consider creating PRs** for:
   - Theme/UI improvements from `origin/cursor/update-theme-typography-spacing-and-colors-75b0`
   - Figma integration from `origin/cursor/export-components-and-themes-to-figma-01c7`

## Branch Management Best Practices Applied

- ✅ Used git workflow standards from `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
- ✅ Preserved important work through clean cherry-picking
- ✅ Automated cleanup using `scripts/cleanup-branches.sh`
- ✅ Followed conventional commit messages
- ✅ Maintained clean history on main branch

## Tools Used

- **Cleanup Script**: `scripts/cleanup-branches.sh` - Automatically removed stale branches
- **Git Workflow**: Following established patterns in `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
- **Cherry-picking**: To preserve important GPS fixes without conflicts

**Result**: Repository is now clean, organized, and ready for continued development with preserved important work ready for PR review.
