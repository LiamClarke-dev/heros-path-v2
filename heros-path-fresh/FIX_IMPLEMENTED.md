# âœ… Maps White Screen Fix Implemented

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Imports
```javascript
// FROM:
import MapView, { Marker, Polyline, PROVIDER_GOOGLE } from 'react-native-maps';

// TO:
import { AppleMaps, GoogleMaps } from 'expo-maps';
```

### 2. Added Helper Functions
- `buildPolylines()` - Converts route data to expo-maps format
- `buildMarkers()` - Converts marker data to expo-maps format

### 3. Replaced MapView Component
- Removed react-native-maps MapView
- Added platform-specific AppleMaps (iOS) and GoogleMaps (Android)
- Changed from JSX children to data props for markers/polylines
- Used cameraPosition instead of initialRegion

### 4. Removed Incompatible Code
- Removed getMapProvider() function
- Removed PROVIDER_GOOGLE references
- Removed renderSavedRoutes() and renderSavedPlaces() functions
- Removed unused region variable

### 5. Added Custom Sprite Overlay
- Link sprite now rendered as overlay (since expo-maps handles markers differently)
- Positioned at map center to follow user location

## Test Command:
```bash
expo start --clear
```

## Expected Result:
- Maps should now render streets and terrain on both iOS and Android
- White screen issue should be resolved
- Link sprite should appear as colored rectangle at map center
- Saved routes and places should display correctly
