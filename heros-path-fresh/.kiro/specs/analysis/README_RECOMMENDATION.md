# Recommendation for Main README.md

## Current Situation

The main README.md at the root of the repository contains:
- Project overview
- Critical update about Google Places API migration
- Latest updates (July 2025)
- Feature descriptions and status
- Tech stack information
- Development workflow guidance
- Project structure

This information is now partially duplicated and expanded upon in our new specification system and steering files.

## Options for Handling README.md

### Option 1: Replace with Reference to New Documentation

Replace the current README.md with a simplified version that:
- Provides a brief project overview
- Directs readers to the new documentation system
- Explains the relationship between specs and steering files
- Includes quick links to key documentation

**Pros:**
- Eliminates duplication
- Ensures single source of truth
- Simplifies maintenance

**Cons:**
- Requires users to navigate to another location for details
- May not provide enough immediate context for casual viewers

### Option 2: Update to Complement New Documentation

Update the current README.md to:
- Maintain the project overview and key information
- Reference the new documentation system for details
- Remove duplicated technical details
- Focus on getting started quickly

**Pros:**
- Maintains good first impression for repository visitors
- Provides immediate context
- Still directs to detailed documentation

**Cons:**
- Some duplication remains
- Requires maintaining multiple sources of information

### Option 3: Archive and Replace

- Move current README.md to docs/ARCHIVE/
- Create a new README.md focused on onboarding
- Include links to both specs and steering files

**Pros:**
- Preserves historical information
- Creates clean slate aligned with new system
- Eliminates duplication

**Cons:**
- Loses historical context in the main view
- Requires significant rewriting

## Recommendation

**Option 2: Update to Complement New Documentation** is recommended because:

1. The README.md is the first thing visitors see on GitHub
2. It should provide immediate context and value
3. It can serve as an entry point to the more detailed documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. **Retain:**
   - Project overview
   - Tech stack summary
   - Quick start instructions

2. **Update:**
   - Feature descriptions to match new specs
   - Development workflow to reference new documentation
   - Status information to reflect current state

3. **Add:**
   - Clear section about the new documentation system
   - Explanation of specs vs. steering files
   - Links to key documentation files

4. **Remove:**
   - Detailed feature descriptions that duplicate specs
   - Outdated status information
   - Redundant technical details

## Proposed README.md Structure

# Hero's Path - React Native/Expo App

## Project Overview

Hero's Path is a React Native/Expo app that lets users track their walks with a glowing polyline and an animated Link sprite, save past routes for later review, and discover nearby points of interest after each outing. It also includes social sharing of walks and curated "Discoveries," plus user-defined goals to make daily walking more engaging.

## üìö Documentation
