# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Developer Tools feature is an advanced suite of testing and debugging utilities designed to help developers efficiently test all app features without needing to physically complete the requirements of each feature. This comprehensive toolset enables simulating journeys, manipulating user data, testing edge cases, and verifying feature functionality in a controlled environment. The tools are organized by priority tiers based on the criticality of the features they support, ensuring that the most important app functionality can be thoroughly tested.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Developer Tools Access and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a comprehensive suite of developer tools through a secure interface, so that I can efficiently test and debug app features without affecting production users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide a method to access the developer tools menu
2. WHEN a special gesture is performed or a debug button is pressed THEN the system SHALL display the developer tools interface
3. WHEN the app is built for production THEN the system SHALL hide developer tools from regular users
4. WHEN a user has the 'admin' tag in the database THEN the system SHALL allow access to developer tools even in production builds
5. WHEN the developer tools are active THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator to prevent confusion with normal app operation
6. WHEN the developer tools interface is opened THEN the system SHALL organize tools into logical categories based on their functionality
7. WHEN a developer tool is activated THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback about its active state
8. WHEN a developer exits the tools interface THEN the system SHALL restore the app to its normal state

### Requirement 2: Journey and Location Simulation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to simulate user journeys and location data, so that I can test location-based features without physically moving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Journey Simulator THEN the system SHALL generate synthetic GPS traces for testing journey tracking
2. WHEN configuring a simulated journey THEN the system SHALL allow selection of different journey patterns (straight lines, loops, complex paths)
3. WHEN running a journey simulation THEN the system SHALL allow control of journey speed, duration, and distance
4. WHEN simulating a journey THEN the system SHALL support testing edge cases like GPS signal loss or erratic movements
5. WHEN using the Location Simulator THEN the system SHALL override the device's actual location with a simulated one
6. WHEN simulating location THEN the system SHALL allow movement along predefined paths
7. WHEN background location tracking is enabled THEN the system SHALL simulate location updates even when the app is in the background
8. WHEN simulating location THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of different accuracy levels and GPS conditions

### Requirement 3: Feature-Specific Testing Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dedicated tools for testing specific app features, so that I can verify their functionality without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Search Along Route Tester THEN the system SHALL allow testing of the SAR algorithm with synthetic routes
2. WHEN testing discovery features THEN the system SHALL provide a Discovery Injector to create mock discoveries
3. WHEN testing user preferences THEN the system SHALL include a Preference Override tool to modify settings
4. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide an Authentication Bypass tool for creating test accounts with predefined states
5. WHEN testing ping functionality THEN the system SHALL include a Ping Credit Manager to add/remove credits and reset cooldowns
6. WHEN testing journey history THEN the system SHALL provide a Journey History Manipulator to create and modify synthetic journeys
7. WHEN testing custom lists THEN the system SHALL include a Custom List Generator to create test lists with various configurations
8. WHEN testing social features THEN the system SHALL provide a Social Interaction Simulator to create mock friends and interactions
9. WHEN testing gamification THEN the system SHALL include a Gamification State Manager to modify experience, levels, and achievements
10. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL provide a Route Generator to create test routes with different characteristics

### Requirement 4: System and Performance Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tools for testing system-level functionality and performance, so that I can identify and resolve issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Database Viewer/Editor THEN the system SHALL allow direct viewing and modification of Firestore data
2. WHEN testing data migration THEN the system SHALL provide tools to export/import test data sets and reset to known states
3. WHEN using the Network Condition Simulator THEN the system SHALL allow testing under different network conditions (slow, offline, intermittent)
4. WHEN testing API interactions THEN the system SHALL provide tools to simulate API failure scenarios
5. WHEN using the Performance Analyzer THEN the system SHALL monitor API call frequency, timing, memory usage, and component rendering
6. WHEN testing notifications THEN the system SHALL include a Notification Tester to trigger different notification types
7. WHEN testing cross-platform functionality THEN the system SHALL provide tools to verify feature consistency across iOS and Android

### Requirement 5: Test Scenario Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save, load, and share test scenarios, so that I can consistently reproduce specific testing conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a test scenario THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the configuration
2. WHEN opening the developer tools THEN the system SHALL display previously saved test scenarios
3. WHEN selecting a saved scenario THEN the system SHALL load all associated configuration settings
4. WHEN a test scenario is active THEN the system SHALL provide an option to modify and update it
5. WHEN exporting a test scenario THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable configuration file
6. WHEN importing a test scenario THEN the system SHALL validate and load the configuration
7. WHEN running a test scenario THEN the system SHALL log relevant events and outcomes for review

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the developer tools to integrate seamlessly with all existing app features, so that I can test the entire application without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer tools are active THEN the system SHALL maintain the functionality of all existing features
2. WHEN simulating data or behavior THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between real and simulated data
3. WHEN deactivating developer tools THEN the system SHALL restore all app components to their normal state
4. WHEN testing interactions between features THEN the system SHALL maintain proper data flow between components
5. WHEN using developer tools THEN the system SHALL minimize impact on the app's performance and resource usage
6. WHEN new features are added to the app THEN the system SHALL provide a framework for extending developer tools to support them
