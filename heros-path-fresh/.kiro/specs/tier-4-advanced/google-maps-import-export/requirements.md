# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Maps Import/Export feature enhances Hero's Path app by enabling seamless data transfer between Hero's Path and Google Maps. This integration allows users to export their custom lists to Google Maps saved lists and import their Google Maps saved places into Hero's Path as "undiscovered" locations. This feature aims to improve interoperability with the Google ecosystem while preserving the app's core exploration-based gameplay mechanics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Google Maps Export

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my Hero's Path custom lists to Google Maps saved lists, so that I can access my curated locations in Google Maps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a custom list in Hero's Path THEN the system SHALL provide an option to export it to Google Maps.
2. WHEN a user initiates an export THEN the system SHALL prompt for Google account authentication if not already authenticated.
3. WHEN a user confirms an export operation THEN the system SHALL transfer all places in the selected custom list to Google Maps as a saved list.
4. WHEN an export is completed THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the number of places successfully exported.
5. WHEN an export encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options.
6. WHEN a place in Hero's Path doesn't have a direct Google Maps equivalent THEN the system SHALL use best-match algorithms to find the closest match.
7. WHEN a user has previously exported a list THEN the system SHALL offer update/overwrite options rather than creating duplicates.

### Requirement 2: Google Maps Import

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import my Google Maps saved places into Hero's Path, so that I can see them on my Hero's Path map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the import feature THEN the system SHALL provide options to import from Google Maps saved lists.
2. WHEN a user initiates an import THEN the system SHALL prompt for Google account authentication if not already authenticated.
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display available Google Maps saved lists for selection.
4. WHEN a user selects lists to import THEN the system SHALL transfer all places from those lists to Hero's Path.
5. WHEN an import is completed THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing the number of places imported.
6. WHEN an import encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and continue with partial imports where possible.
7. WHEN a place already exists in Hero's Path THEN the system SHALL avoid creating duplicates and maintain the existing discovery status.

### Requirement 3: Undiscovered State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want imported places to be in an "undiscovered state" that doesn't count toward gamification features until I've physically explored them, so that the integrity of the exploration gameplay is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN places are imported from Google Maps THEN the system SHALL mark them as "undiscovered" in the Hero's Path database.
2. WHEN displaying imported places on the map THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling to differentiate them from discovered places.
3. WHEN a user physically visits an imported place THEN the system SHALL convert it from "undiscovered" to "discovered" status.
4. WHEN an imported place is converted to "discovered" THEN the system SHALL apply all normal discovery rewards and gamification elements.
5. WHEN calculating statistics or achievements THEN the system SHALL exclude "undiscovered" imported places from counts.
6. WHEN displaying place details THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the import source and discovery status.
7. IF an imported place is within the discovery radius of the user's current location during import THEN the system SHALL still maintain its "undiscovered" status until explicitly visited.

### Requirement 4: Visibility Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to toggle visibility of imported pins on my map, so that I can control map clutter and focus on specific types of places.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the map THEN the system SHALL provide controls to toggle visibility of imported places.
2. WHEN the user disables visibility of imported places THEN the system SHALL hide all imported place markers from the map view.
3. WHEN the user enables visibility of imported places THEN the system SHALL show all imported place markers on the map view.
4. WHEN the user opens the map for the first time after an import THEN the system SHALL have imported places visible by default.
5. WHEN the user adjusts visibility settings THEN the system SHALL persist these preferences for future sessions.
6. WHEN visibility filters are applied THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about which filters are active.
7. WHEN the user has multiple imports from different sources THEN the system SHALL allow toggling visibility for each import source independently.

### Requirement 5: Import Management

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses import management THEN the system SHALL display a list of past imports with dates and source information.
2. WHEN a user selects a past import THEN the system SHALL provide options to view details or delete the entire import.
3. WHEN a user confirms deletion of an import THEN the system SHALL remove all places associated with that specific import.
4. WHEN deletion is completed THEN the system SHALL confirm the number of places removed.
5. WHEN a user attempts to delete an import THEN the system SHALL warn if any imported places have been converted to discovered status.
6. IF discovered places are included in an import being deleted THEN the system SHALL provide options to keep or delete these places.
7. WHEN managing imports THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental deletion through confirmation dialogs.
