# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Migration feature is an advanced system maintenance capability that ensures smooth transitions between app versions when database schemas or storage mechanisms change. It preserves user data integrity while enabling new features and improvements without disrupting the user experience. This system handles app version updates, data structure changes, and provides user data cleanup utilities.

## Requirements

### 1. Version Migration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to automatically detect and migrate data between different app versions, so that users can seamlessly upgrade without losing their data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts up THEN the system SHALL check the current app version against the stored data version.
2. WHEN a version mismatch is detected THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate migration path.
3. WHEN a migration path is determined THEN the system SHALL execute migrations in the correct sequence.
4. WHEN migrations are completed THEN the system SHALL update the stored data version marker.
5. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide a rollback mechanism to restore data to its previous state.
6. WHEN multiple version upgrades are detected (user skipped versions) THEN the system SHALL execute all required migrations in the correct order.

### 2. Storage System Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate user data between different storage systems (e.g., AsyncStorage to Firestore), so that we can improve app architecture without losing historical user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a storage system migration is needed THEN the system SHALL identify all data that needs to be transferred.
2. WHEN transferring data between storage systems THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and relationships.
3. WHEN data is successfully migrated to the new storage system THEN the system SHALL mark the migration as complete.
4. WHEN a storage migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates.
5. WHEN a storage migration fails THEN the system SHALL not delete the original data.
6. WHEN a storage migration is completed THEN the system SHALL verify the migrated data for completeness and correctness.

### 3. Data Structure Evolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evolve data structures over time, so that we can improve app performance and add new features without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data structure changes are needed THEN the system SHALL transform data from old formats to new formats.
2. WHEN fields are added to a data structure THEN the system SHALL populate default values for existing records.

6. WHEN data structure changes are complex THEN the system SHALL perform transformations in atomic batches.

### 4. User Experience During Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be informed about data migrations when necessary, so that I understand what's happening with my data during app updates.

1. WHEN a migration is quick (under 2 seconds) THEN the system SHALL perform it silently without user notification.
2. WHEN a migration will take significant time THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator.
3. WHEN a migration requires user input THEN the system SHALL prompt the user with clear instructions.
4. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL inform the user with a helpful error message.
5. WHEN a migration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL notify the user only if the migration was visible.
6. WHEN a migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent user actions that could corrupt the migration.

### 5. Migration Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed logging and monitoring of migrations, so that I can diagnose and fix issues that occur during the migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a migration starts THEN the system SHALL log the start time and migration details.

3. WHEN a migration encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information.
4. WHEN a migration completes THEN the system SHALL log summary statistics about the migration.
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of the migration process.
6. WHEN a migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL track and report progress percentage.

### 6. Manual Migration Controls

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to be able to trigger migrations manually and view migration status, so that I can manage data migrations for testing and troubleshooting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the settings screen THEN the system SHALL display migration status information.
2. WHEN a manual migration is triggered THEN the system SHALL execute the migration process.
3. WHEN viewing migration status THEN the system SHALL show statistics about completed migrations.
4. WHEN a migration is pending THEN the system SHALL provide an option to start it manually.
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide options to rollback migrations for testing.
6. WHEN migration details are requested THEN the system SHALL show which data types have been migrated.

### 7. Data Integrity and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure data integrity during migrations, so that user data remains consistent and valid after schema or storage changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a migration completes THEN the system SHALL validate the migrated data against the new schema.
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log specific validation errors.
3. WHEN data is found to be invalid THEN the system SHALL attempt to repair or normalize it.
4. WHEN data cannot be automatically repaired THEN the system SHALL quarantine it for manual review.
5. WHEN a migration involves critical user data THEN the system SHALL create a backup before migration.
6. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity during migration.

### Requirement 8: Complex Transformations
