## Multi-Agent Documentation Workflow

We've implemented a specialized multi-agent workflow to accelerate the documentation process:

1. **Documentation Coordinator**
   - Initiates and tracks the documentation process
   - Creates metadata.json to track progress
   - Triggers specialized agents for each phase

2. **Feature Research Agent**
   - Reviews existing documentation
   - Analyzes code implementation
   - Creates requirements.md document
   - Updates metadata with requirements information

3. **Design Documentation Agent**
   - Takes requirements as input
   - Documents architecture and components
   - Creates design.md document
   - Updates metadata with design information

4. **Tasks Documentation Agent**
   - Takes requirements and design as input
   - Breaks down implementation into tasks
   - Creates tasks.md document
   - Updates metadata to mark completion

5. **Documentation-Steering Consistency Checker**
   - Verifies alignment between steering files and specifications
   - Identifies inconsistencies or contradictions
   - Suggests specific changes to maintain alignment
   - Ensures cohesive vision across all documentation

See [DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md](./DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md) for detailed instructions on using this workflow.
