# Hero's Path - Documentation Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

1. ✅ Created a structured directory system for feature specifications
2. ✅ Developed templates for requirements, design, and tasks documents
3. ✅ Created a master index of all features
4. ✅ Created a comprehensive feature map with visualizations
5. ✅ Set up an archive for legacy documentation
6. ✅ Created a documentation guide explaining the new structure
7. ✅ Performed dependency analysis across features
8. ✅ Assessed feature prioritization and recommended adjustments
9. ✅ Created specifications for all current and planned features

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Reprioritized Features

Based on our reprioritization assessment:

1. **Developer Tools (Core)**
   - [x] Moved from Tier 4 to Tier 2
   - [x] Create directory structure in tier-2-important
   - [x] Move and update specifications
   - [ ] Implement core testing utilities first:
     - [ ] Journey Simulator
     - [ ] Location Simulator
     - [ ] Authentication Bypass
     - [ ] Discovery Injector

2. **Data Migration (Core)**
   - [x] Moved from Tier 4 to Tier 2
   - [x] Create directory structure in tier-2-important
   - [x] Move and update specifications
   - [ ] Implement core migration framework:
     - [ ] Version tracking system
     - [ ] Basic schema evolution support
     - [ ] Migration logging

### 2. Add Extension Points to Existing Specs

Update existing specifications to include necessary extension points:

#### Tier 1 Features
- [ ] User Authentication: Add social profile data structure and third-party auth support
- [ ] Map Navigation & GPS: Add support for custom overlays and modular map controls
- [ ] Journey Tracking: Extend data model for gamification and sharing attributes
- [ ] Background Location: Add support for different tracking modes
- [ ] Search Along Route: Add support for enhanced filtering and AI recommendations

#### Tier 2 Features
- [ ] Ping Discovery: Add support for enhanced animations and gamification integration
- [ ] Discovery Preferences: Add support for theme-based discovery
- [ ] Past Journeys Review: Add support for social sharing indicators
- [ ] Saved Places: Add support for custom list associations
- [ ] Discovery Consolidation: Add support for enhanced place data

### 3. Standardize Error Handling and Offline Support

- [ ] Define common error handling patterns
- [ ] Update all specs to follow these patterns
- [ ] Define offline support requirements for relevant features
- [ ] Update specs to include offline functionality

### 4. Verify Consistency with Steering Files

- [ ] Ensure all specs follow technical guidance in tech.md
- [ ] Verify feature descriptions match product.md
- [ ] Confirm implementation follows structure.md patterns
- [ ] Create automated consistency check using agent hook

### 5. Update Main README.md

- [ ] Update main README.md to reference the new documentation structure
- [ ] Add links to key specs and guides
- [ ] Explain relationship between specs and steering files
- [ ] Provide guidance on development sequence

### 6. Implement Development Sequence

Follow the recommended development sequence from FEATURE_MAP.md:

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] User Authentication (existing)
- [ ] Map Navigation & GPS (existing)
- [ ] **Developer Tools (Core)** (reprioritized)
- [ ] Background Location (existing)
- [ ] **Data Migration (Core)** (reprioritized)

#### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Journey Tracking (existing)
- [ ] Search Along Route (SAR) (existing)
- [ ] Discovery Preferences (existing)
- [ ] Ping Discovery (existing)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization (Core)** (partial reprioritization)

### 7. Regular Documentation Maintenance

- [ ] Schedule quarterly documentation reviews
- [ ] Update specs when features change
- [ ] Verify cross-tier consistency
- [ ] Keep dependency analysis up to date

## Multi-Agent Documentation Workflow

We've implemented a specialized multi-agent workflow to accelerate the documentation process:

1. **Documentation Coordinator**
   - Initiates and tracks the documentation process
   - Creates metadata.json to track progress
   - Triggers specialized agents for each phase

2. **Feature Research Agent**
   - Reviews existing documentation
   - Analyzes code implementation
   - Creates requirements.md document
   - Updates metadata with requirements information

3. **Design Documentation Agent**
   - Takes requirements as input
   - Documents architecture and components
   - Creates design.md document
   - Updates metadata with design information

4. **Tasks Documentation Agent**
   - Takes requirements and design as input
   - Breaks down implementation into tasks
   - Creates tasks.md document
   - Updates metadata to mark completion

5. **Documentation-Steering Consistency Checker**
   - Verifies alignment between steering files and specifications
   - Identifies inconsistencies or contradictions
   - Suggests specific changes to maintain alignment
   - Ensures cohesive vision across all documentation

See [DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md](./DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md) for detailed instructions on using this workflow.
