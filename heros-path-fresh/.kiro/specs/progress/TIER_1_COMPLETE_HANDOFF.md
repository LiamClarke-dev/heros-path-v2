## Common Patterns Established

### Data Model Extensions
All Tier 1 features now include:
```typescript
interface BaseDataModel {
  // Migration support
  schemaVersion: number;
  lastMigrationAt?: string;
  migrationHistory?: {
    version: number;
    migratedAt: string;
    changes: string[];
  }[];
  
  // Developer tools support
  devMode?: boolean;
  mockData?: boolean;
  
  // Performance optimization
  lastUpdated: string;
  cacheKey?: string;
  
  // Extension points
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  extensions?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Dependencies and Extensions Section
Each spec now includes:
- **Dependent Features**: List of features that depend on this feature
- **Extension Points**: Detailed description of extension points
- **Migration Considerations**: Schema version and compatibility info
- **Developer Tools Integration**: Testing and simulation support
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and optimization strategies

### Terminology Consistency
All specs use consistent terminology:
- ✅ "Journey" (not "route", "path", or "walk")
- ✅ "Discovery" (not "place" or "POI")
- ✅ "Ping" (not "scan" or "search")
- ✅ "Saved Place" (not "favorite" or "bookmark")
- ✅ "User Profile" (not "account" or "user data")
- ✅ "Authentication" (not "login" or "signin")
