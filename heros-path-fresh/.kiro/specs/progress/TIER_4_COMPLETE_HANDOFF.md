## Architectural Foundation

### Data Model Consistency
All features now include standardized fields:
- `schemaVersion: number` - Migration tracking
- `lastMigrationAt?: string` - Migration timestamp  
- `migrationHistory?: object[]` - Migration history
- `devMode?: boolean` - Developer tools support
- `mockData?: boolean` - Mock data indicators
- `lastUpdated: string` - Performance optimization
- `cacheKey?: string` - Caching support
- `metadata?: Record<string, any>` - Extension points
- `extensions?: Record<string, any>` - Future extensibility

### Terminology Consistency
All specs use consistent terminology:
- ✅ "Journey" (not "route", "path", or "walk")
- ✅ "Discovery" (not "place" or "POI")
- ✅ "Ping" (not "scan" or "search")
- ✅ "Saved Place" (not "favorite" or "bookmark")
- ✅ "User Profile" (not "account" or "user data")
- ✅ "Authentication" (not "login" or "signin")
