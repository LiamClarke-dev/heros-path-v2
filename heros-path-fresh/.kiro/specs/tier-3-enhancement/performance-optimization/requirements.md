# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Performance Optimization feature aims to significantly improve the Hero's Path app's performance, responsiveness, and data consistency through smart caching, API call reduction, real-time status updates, and data integrity improvements. This enhancement focuses on technical excellence to provide a faster, more responsive user experience while reducing API costs and server load. The feature builds upon existing tier-1 and tier-2 features, enhancing their performance rather than introducing new user-facing functionality.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a journey that has existing discoveries in Firestore THEN the system SHALL load discoveries from Firestore without making API calls.
2. WHEN a user opens a new journey with no existing discoveries THEN the system SHALL make API calls to fetch discovery data.
3. WHEN a user explicitly refreshes the discoveries screen THEN the system SHALL reload data from Firestore only, not making new API calls.
4. WHEN the system detects existing journey discoveries THEN the system SHALL skip API calls for place suggestions.
5. WHEN the system loads journey discoveries THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator until data is available.

### Requirement 2: API Call Optimization

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want the app to minimize API calls when I interact with discoveries, so that the app remains responsive and doesn't hit rate limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user saves a place THEN the system SHALL update the local state without making API calls.
3. WHEN a user undoes a dismiss action THEN the system SHALL restore the place without making API calls.
4. WHEN a user undoes a save action THEN the system SHALL restore the place without making API calls.
5. WHEN the system needs to update discovery status THEN the system SHALL use local Firestore operations instead of external API calls.
6. WHEN the system loads existing journeys THEN the system SHALL achieve at least a 90% reduction in API calls compared to the previous implementation.

### Requirement 3: Real-time Status Updates

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want journey completion status to update immediately when I interact with discoveries, so that I have accurate feedback on my progress.

1. WHEN a user saves or dismisses a discovery THEN the system SHALL immediately update the journey completion status.
2. WHEN a user undoes a save or dismiss action THEN the system SHALL immediately update the journey completion status.
3. WHEN journey completion status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI without requiring additional database queries.
4. WHEN the system calculates journey completion percentage THEN the system SHALL accurately reflect the ratio of reviewed discoveries to total discoveries.
5. WHEN a user views the PastJourneysScreen THEN the system SHALL display accurate 'Review' vs 'âœ… All Reviewed' status indicators.

### Requirement 4: Data Consistency Improvements

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want all my discovery data to remain consistent across the app, so that I don't experience confusing discrepancies or data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any discovery action THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity across all Firestore collections.
2. WHEN a discovery is saved THEN the system SHALL ensure it appears in both the journey discoveries and saved places collections.
3. WHEN a discovery is dismissed THEN the system SHALL ensure it appears in both the journey discoveries and dismissed places collections.
4. WHEN a user undoes a discovery action THEN the system SHALL restore consistent state across all affected collections.
5. WHEN the system encounters an error during data operations THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and recovery.

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Debug Logging

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path developer, I want comprehensive debug logging for performance-critical operations, so that I can monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the app's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any performance-critical operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the operation.
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log the purpose, parameters, and results of the call.
3. WHEN data consistency operations occur THEN the system SHALL log the before and after states.
4. WHEN performance optimizations are active THEN the system SHALL log metrics about API call reduction and performance improvements.
5. WHEN the system is in production mode THEN the system SHALL disable debug logging to maintain optimal performance.
6. WHEN the system logs performance data THEN the system SHALL include timing information for key operations.

### Requirement 6: Pull-to-Refresh Functionality

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want to be able to manually refresh my discoveries when needed, so that I can ensure my data is up-to-date without restarting the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pulls down on the discoveries screen THEN the system SHALL provide a visual indicator that refresh is in progress.
2. WHEN a refresh is initiated THEN the system SHALL reload data from Firestore without making API calls.
3. WHEN a refresh completes THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message to the user.
4. WHEN a refresh encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
5. WHEN a refresh is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate refresh operations.

### Requirement 7: Smart Caching Implementation
