# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Enhanced Places Integration is a data quality enhancement feature for Hero's Path that leverages Google Places API v1 with advanced capabilities. This feature provides a unified interface for all place-related functionality with automatic fallback mechanisms, AI-powered place summaries, enhanced photo handling, comprehensive metadata, and optimized performance. The integration ensures consistent response data across all endpoints, eliminates duplicate detection issues, and provides a seamless user experience with improved place information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified API Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified interface for all place-related functionality, so that I can access consistent place data regardless of the underlying API version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app needs to access place data THEN the system SHALL use a single unified interface
2. WHEN the new Google Places API v1 is available THEN the system SHALL use it as the primary data source
3. WHEN the new Google Places API v1 fails or is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to the legacy API
4. WHEN retrieving place data THEN the system SHALL transform responses into a consistent format regardless of the source API
5. WHEN handling place data THEN the system SHALL provide consistent field names and data structures across all endpoints

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Place Summaries

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered summaries of places I discover, so that I can quickly understand what makes each place interesting or unique.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying place details THEN the system SHALL include AI-powered summaries when available
2. WHEN showing AI-generated content THEN the system SHALL include proper "Summarized with Gemini" disclosure
3. WHEN AI summaries are not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to editorial summaries if available
4. WHEN neither AI nor editorial summaries are available THEN the system SHALL generate a basic summary from available place data
5. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL respect user language preferences

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Photo Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want high-quality photos of places I discover, so that I can visually assess if a place interests me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying place information THEN the system SHALL include high-quality photos when available
2. WHEN generating photo URLs THEN the system SHALL handle both new and legacy photo references correctly
3. WHEN requesting photos THEN the system SHALL optimize image size based on the display context
4. WHEN photos are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate placeholder images
5. WHEN handling multiple photos THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most relevant and high-quality images

### Requirement 4: Platform-Specific API Key Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper platform-specific API key selection, so that the app works correctly on both iOS and Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on iOS THEN the system SHALL use the iOS-specific Google Maps API key
2. WHEN running on Android THEN the system SHALL use the Android-specific Google Maps API key
3. WHEN selecting API keys THEN the system SHALL use Platform.OS to determine the correct key
4. WHEN an API key for the current platform is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to any available key
5. WHEN no valid API keys are available THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 5: Field Masking for Optimized Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement field masking for API requests, so that I can optimize performance and reduce API costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use field masking to request only needed data fields
2. WHEN defining field masks THEN the system SHALL include only essential fields that are definitely supported
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing fields that weren't requested
4. WHEN optimizing requests THEN the system SHALL balance data completeness with performance considerations
5. WHEN implementing field masking THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing code

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle API errors gracefully, so that my experience isn't disrupted by technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover using appropriate fallback mechanisms
2. WHEN all API attempts fail THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging purposes
4. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
5. WHEN API services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 7: Consistent Response Data

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent response data across all endpoints, so that I can build reliable features without worrying about data format inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transforming API responses THEN the system SHALL normalize data structures to a consistent format
2. WHEN handling place data THEN the system SHALL use consistent field names across all services
3. WHEN processing place types THEN the system SHALL normalize type identifiers to eliminate inconsistencies
4. WHEN dealing with different API versions THEN the system SHALL map fields correctly between versions
5. WHEN providing place data to UI components THEN the system SHALL ensure all required fields are present

### Requirement 8: Primary Place Types

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate place type categorization, so that I can filter and find places that match my interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing places THEN the system SHALL use primary place types to eliminate duplicate detection
2. WHEN displaying place types THEN the system SHALL show the most relevant type first
3. WHEN filtering places by type THEN the system SHALL respect the primary type designation
4. WHEN handling places with multiple types THEN the system SHALL maintain the full list of types for reference
5. WHEN a place has no explicit primary type THEN the system SHALL intelligently determine the most appropriate primary type
