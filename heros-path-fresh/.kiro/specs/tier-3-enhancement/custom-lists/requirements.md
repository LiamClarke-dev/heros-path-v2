# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Custom Lists feature enhances the Hero's Path app by allowing users to organize their saved places into personalized, themed collections. This feature builds upon the existing Saved Places functionality, providing users with a more structured way to categorize and access their favorite locations. Users will be able to create multiple lists (e.g., "Tokyo Cafes", "LA Bars", "2025 Favorites"), manage list metadata, and add places to multiple lists simultaneously.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: List Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to create custom lists from my saved places, so that I can organize my discoveries into meaningful collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Saved Places screen THEN the system SHALL provide an option to view and manage custom lists.
2. WHEN a user selects the option to create a new list THEN the system SHALL prompt for a list name and optional description.
3. WHEN a user submits a new list THEN the system SHALL create the list and associate it with the user's account.
4. WHEN a user views their lists THEN the system SHALL display all lists created by the user.
5. WHEN a user selects a list THEN the system SHALL display all places added to that list.
6. WHEN a user chooses to delete a list THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before removing the list.
7. IF a user deletes a list THEN the system SHALL maintain the saved places themselves, only removing the list organization.

### Requirement 2: Intuitive Navigation and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UX navigation of these lists to feel intuitive and easy to sort through, so that I can efficiently manage a large number of lists over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has multiple lists THEN the system SHALL provide a scrollable, visually distinct grid or list view.
2. WHEN a user has more than 10 lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or infinite scrolling.
3. WHEN a user navigates to the lists screen THEN the system SHALL provide sorting options (e.g., alphabetical, recently updated, date created).
4. WHEN a user has many lists THEN the system SHALL provide a search function to quickly find specific lists.
5. WHEN a user views the lists screen THEN the system SHALL display visual thumbnails representing each list.
6. WHEN a user navigates between lists THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and maintain context.
7. IF the device is offline THEN the system SHALL still allow navigation through previously loaded lists.

### Requirement 3: List Metadata and Content Editing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to easily edit the metadata of my custom lists, as well as the locations within them, so that I can keep my collections current and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects to edit a list THEN the system SHALL provide options to modify the list name and description.
2. WHEN a user is viewing a list THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add or remove places from that list.
3. WHEN a user is editing a list THEN the system SHALL allow reordering of places within the list.
4. WHEN a user edits list metadata THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and prevent empty list names.
5. WHEN a user removes a place from a list THEN the system SHALL maintain the place in the saved places collection.
6. WHEN a user edits a list THEN the system SHALL save changes automatically or provide a clear save option.
7. IF a user attempts to create a list with a duplicate name THEN the system SHALL notify the user and request a unique name.

### Requirement 4: Cross-List Place Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to easily find and add the same location into multiple custom lists, so that I can categorize places in different ways without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a saved place THEN the system SHALL display all lists that contain this place.
2. WHEN a user selects to add a place to a list THEN the system SHALL show existing lists with options to select multiple.
3. WHEN a user is viewing a place within a list THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add to additional lists.
4. WHEN a user removes a place from all lists THEN the system SHALL maintain the place in the saved places collection.
5. WHEN a user adds a new place to saved places THEN the system SHALL provide an option to immediately add it to one or more lists.
6. IF a user attempts to add a place to a list it's already in THEN the system SHALL prevent duplication and notify the user.

### Requirement 5: Enhanced List Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to advanced list features, so that I can get more value and functionality from my custom lists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a list is created or updated THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a visual thumbnail using place photos.
2. WHEN a user has multiple places in a list THEN the system SHALL provide a map view showing all places in that list.
3. WHEN a user views a list THEN the system SHALL display statistics about the list (e.g., number of places, average rating).
4. WHEN a user has similar places THEN the system SHALL suggest potential list categories based on place types or geographic clustering.
5. WHEN a user views a list THEN the system SHALL provide a way to export the list data (preparing for future social sharing capabilities).
6. IF a user has inactive lists THEN the system SHALL provide an archive option to hide lists without deleting them.
7. WHEN a user is creating a new list THEN the system SHALL offer pre-made list templates as starting points.

### Requirement 6: Offline Support and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my lists to be available offline and properly synchronized when connectivity returns, so that I can access my organized places anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a device is offline THEN the system SHALL allow viewing and editing of previously loaded lists.
2. WHEN a device regains connectivity THEN the system SHALL synchronize any offline changes with the server.
3. WHEN synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL handle conflict resolution with appropriate user notification.
4. WHEN a user has limited connectivity THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential list data over images or other media.
5. IF synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and notify the user only after multiple failures.
6. WHEN a user makes changes offline THEN the system SHALL indicate which data is pending synchronization.

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the custom lists feature to perform well even with many lists and places, so that I have a smooth experience regardless of how extensively I use the feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has 50+ lists THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance.
2. WHEN a list contains 100+ places THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualized lists for performance.
3. WHEN loading list data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states and placeholders.
4. WHEN a user performs list operations THEN the system SHALL execute them without blocking the UI thread.
5. WHEN a user has many lists with many places THEN the system SHALL optimize storage usage through efficient data structures.
6. IF loading large lists takes more than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators.
