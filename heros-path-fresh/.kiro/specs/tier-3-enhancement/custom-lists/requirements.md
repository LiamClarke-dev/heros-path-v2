# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Custom Lists feature enhances the Hero's Path app by allowing users to organize their saved places into personalized, themed collections. This feature builds upon the existing Saved Places functionality, providing users with a more structured way to categorize and access their favorite locations. Users will be able to create multiple lists (e.g., "Tokyo Cafes", "LA Bars", "2025 Favorites"), manage list metadata, and add places to multiple lists simultaneously.

## Requirements
