# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gamification feature enhances the Hero's Path app by adding game-like elements to increase user engagement, motivation, and retention. This feature transforms exploration into an achievement-based experience with visual progress tracking, quests, experience points, badges, and other rewards that make walking and discovering new places more engaging and fun. By incorporating elements from game design, the app will provide users with clear goals, visual feedback on progress, and meaningful rewards for their exploration activities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Route Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my past routes visually "painting in the streets" on the map screen, so that I can create a visual record of my exploration and be motivated to explore new areas.
