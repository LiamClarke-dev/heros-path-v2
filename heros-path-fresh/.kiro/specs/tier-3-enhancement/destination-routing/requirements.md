# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Destination Routing feature enhances the Hero's Path app's navigation capabilities by providing users with multiple routing options to reach their destinations. Unlike standard navigation apps that focus solely on optimal routing, this feature aligns with the app's exploration and discovery focus by offering specialized routing modes that encourage users to explore new areas or discover points of interest along their journey. This feature aims to transform routine travel into opportunities for exploration and discovery while still providing practical navigation assistance.

## Requirements
