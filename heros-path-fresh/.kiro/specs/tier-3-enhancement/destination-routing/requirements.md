# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Destination Routing feature enhances the Hero's Path app's navigation capabilities by providing users with multiple routing options to reach their destinations. Unlike standard navigation apps that focus solely on optimal routing, this feature aligns with the app's exploration and discovery focus by offering specialized routing modes that encourage users to explore new areas or discover points of interest along their journey. This feature aims to transform routine travel into opportunities for exploration and discovery while still providing practical navigation assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Destination Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set a destination in the app and receive walking directions to that location, so that I can navigate to places I want to visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the map screen THEN the system SHALL provide a clear option to set a destination.
2. WHEN the user taps the destination option THEN the system SHALL display a search interface for finding locations.
3. WHEN the user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL display relevant location results.
4. WHEN the user selects a location from search results THEN the system SHALL set it as the destination.
5. WHEN a destination is set THEN the system SHALL display available routing options.
6. WHEN the user selects a routing option THEN the system SHALL display the route on the map.
7. WHEN a route is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide turn-by-turn navigation instructions.

### Requirement 2: Multiple Routing Modes

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between different routing modes, so that I can tailor my journey to my current goals (efficiency, exploration, or discovery).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sets a destination THEN the system SHALL offer at least three routing modes: Optimal, Exploration, and Discovery.
2. WHEN the user selects "Optimal" routing THEN the system SHALL calculate the fastest/shortest path to the destination.
3. WHEN the user selects "Exploration" routing THEN the system SHALL generate a route that includes unexplored streets or areas.
4. WHEN the user selects "Discovery" routing THEN the system SHALL generate a route that passes through areas with high points of interest density.
5. WHEN displaying route options THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the characteristics of each route (distance, estimated time, exploration potential, discovery potential).
6. WHEN the user has previously explored an area THEN the system SHALL consider this data when generating "Exploration" routes.
7. WHEN points of interest exist in the vicinity THEN the system SHALL consider this data when generating "Discovery" routes.

### Requirement 3: Routing Preferences

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set routing preferences to prevent non-sensical routes, so that I can ensure routes remain practical while still enabling exploration and discovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses routing settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to customize routing preferences.
2. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify maximum deviation from optimal routing (in minutes or distance).
3. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify preferred point of interest categories for Discovery mode.
4. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL allow the user to prioritize unexplored areas based on recency or completeness for Exploration mode.
5. WHEN generating routes THEN the system SHALL respect the user's preference settings.
6. WHEN preferences would result in no viable route THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest adjustments.
7. WHEN the user changes preferences THEN the system SHALL immediately update route calculations if a destination is set.

### Requirement 4: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want the routing experience to be seamlessly integrated with the app's existing journey tracking and discovery features, so that I can maintain a cohesive experience while using navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is navigating a route THEN the system SHALL continue to track the journey as part of the user's exploration history.
2. WHEN the user is navigating a route THEN the system SHALL continue to identify and notify about nearby discoveries.
3. WHEN the user makes a discovery while on a route THEN the system SHALL allow them to interact with the discovery without abandoning navigation.
4. WHEN the user deviates from the route THEN the system SHALL offer to recalculate or continue journey tracking without navigation.
5. WHEN the user completes a route THEN the system SHALL update their exploration statistics and history.
6. WHEN the user has active discovery preferences THEN the system SHALL incorporate these into Discovery mode routing.
7. WHEN the user views their past journeys THEN the system SHALL include navigated routes with appropriate indicators.

### Requirement 5: Route Preview and Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see different route options before beginning my journey, so that I can make an informed decision about which path to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN route options are calculated THEN the system SHALL display multiple route alternatives on the map simultaneously.
2. WHEN displaying route options THEN the system SHALL visually differentiate between different routing modes.
3. WHEN displaying route options THEN the system SHALL provide summary information for each route (distance, time, unique features).
4. WHEN the user taps on a specific route THEN the system SHALL highlight that route and display detailed information.
5. WHEN detailed route information is displayed THEN the system SHALL show turn-by-turn overview and potential discoveries.
6. WHEN the user selects a route THEN the system SHALL initiate navigation for that specific route.
7. WHEN no satisfactory routes are found THEN the system SHALL allow the user to adjust preferences or routing modes.

### Requirement 6: Time-Based Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify how much time I have available for my journey, so that the app can generate routes that fit within my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up navigation THEN the system SHALL provide an option to specify available time for the journey.
2. WHEN the user specifies available time THEN the system SHALL generate route options that can be completed within that timeframe.
3. WHEN generating time-based routes THEN the system SHALL consider walking speed and potential stops at points of interest.
4. WHEN the available time is insufficient for reaching the destination THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest alternatives.
5. WHEN displaying time-based routes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the estimated completion time.
6. WHEN the user deviates from the route or spends more time than estimated at stops THEN the system SHALL recalculate and update the route accordingly.

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Options

**User Story:** As a user, I want routing options that prioritize accessibility, so that I can navigate comfortably based on my physical needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting routing preferences THEN the system SHALL provide accessibility options.
2. WHEN accessibility options are enabled THEN the system SHALL avoid routes with stairs, steep inclines, or other specified barriers.
3. WHEN generating accessible routes THEN the system SHALL prioritize sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian-friendly paths.
4. WHEN no fully accessible route is available THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate accessibility challenges in the route preview.
5. WHEN the user has set specific accessibility preferences THEN the system SHALL apply these across all routing modes.
