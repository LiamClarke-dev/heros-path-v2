# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Journey Completion feature enhances the existing journey tracking functionality in Hero's Path by providing an improved workflow for ending, naming, and saving completed journeys. Building upon the core journey tracking capabilities, this enhancement focuses on creating a more polished and user-friendly experience when concluding walks. The feature includes a full-screen naming modal with smart default naming, improved journey statistics display, better minimum distance validation, and tighter integration with the discovery process to ensure a seamless end-of-journey experience.

## Requirements
