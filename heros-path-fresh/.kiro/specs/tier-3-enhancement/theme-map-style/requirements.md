# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Theme & Map Style feature provides a comprehensive theming system for the Hero's Path app, allowing users to personalize their experience through multiple UI themes and map styles. This feature enhances user experience by providing visual customization options, improving accessibility through different contrast modes, and creating a more immersive adventure experience through themed map styles. The system is built on React Context for centralized theme management and uses AsyncStorage for persistent user preferences.
