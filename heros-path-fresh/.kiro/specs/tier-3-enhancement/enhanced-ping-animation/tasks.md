- [ ] 7. Integrate with MapScreen
  - [ ] 7.1 Position animation relative to user sprite
    - Center animation on the user's Link sprite position on the map
    - Ensure animation follows sprite movement if user moves during animation
    - Implement proper z-index layering so animation appears to emanate from sprite
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_
  
  - [ ] 7.2 Implement map snap functionality
    - Add map snapping to center on user location when ping is activated

    - Handle edge cases like rapid consecutive pings
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_
  
  - [ ] 7.3 Connect animation to ping button events
    - Connect animation triggers to ping button press events
    - Ensure animation state is properly reset between activations
    - Test integration with real map interaction
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 8. Add settings controls
  - Add haptic feedback toggle to Settings screen
  - Implement settings persistence with AsyncStorage
