# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Ping Animation feature aims to transform the current ping functionality into a more engaging, gamified experience that provides users with clear visual feedback when discovering points of interest during their walks. The current ping animation system, while functional, lacks the dramatic and impactful feel that would make the discovery process more exciting and rewarding. This enhancement will make the ping feature feel like a "special power" that users can charge up and release, creating a more immersive and satisfying exploration experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user exploring new areas, I want a more dramatic and engaging ping animation, so that I feel rewarded and excited when discovering new places.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user activates the ping feature THEN the system SHALL display a charging animation that builds up over 1-2 seconds
2. WHEN the charging animation completes THEN the system SHALL display a release animation that expands outward for 2-3 seconds
3. WHEN the ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL ensure the animation is screen-dominating and visually impactful
4. WHEN the ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL NOT block user interaction with the map or other UI elements
5. WHEN the ping animation completes THEN the system SHALL smoothly fade out without abruptly disappearing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and optimized ping animation experience, so that the app feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user activates ping THEN the system SHALL display a single, well-designed animation style
2. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency with the app's overall design language
3. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL use colors that adapt to the current theme
4. WHEN ping animation is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it is visually distinct from other UI elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with sensory preferences, I want haptic feedback during the ping process, so that I receive multi-sensory confirmation of the ping action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates a ping THEN the system SHALL provide light haptic feedback
2. WHEN ping charging animation reaches its peak THEN the system SHALL provide medium haptic feedback
3. WHEN ping release animation begins THEN the system SHALL provide strong haptic feedback
4. IF user has disabled haptic feedback in device settings THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to trigger haptics
5. WHEN user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide an option to disable haptic feedback specifically for pings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with varying device capabilities, I want the ping animation to perform well on all supported devices, so that my experience isn't degraded on older hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum of 30fps on supported devices
2. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL NOT cause noticeable battery drain
3. IF device is in low-power mode THEN the system SHALL automatically use a simplified animation
4. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL NOT interfere with GPS tracking or other critical functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the ping feature to be fully accessible, so that I can use it regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL NOT rely solely on color to convey information
2. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL support screen readers by announcing appropriate status messages
3. WHEN ping button is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it meets minimum touch target size requirements (44x44pt)
4. WHEN ping animation is active THEN the system SHALL respect reduced motion settings if enabled on the device
