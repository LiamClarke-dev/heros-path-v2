See [FEATURE_MAP.md](./FEATURE_MAP.md) for the complete recommended development sequence.

## Spec Template

Each feature specification follows a standardized format:

1. **Requirements Document** (`requirements.md`)

   - Introduction and overview
   - User stories with acceptance criteria in EARS format
   - Edge cases and constraints

2. **Design Document** (`design.md`)

   - Architecture and system design
   - Component interfaces
   - Data models
   - Error handling
   - Testing strategy
   - Performance considerations

3. **Tasks Document** (`tasks.md`)
   - Implementation tasks with references to requirements
   - Testing tasks
   - Integration points

## Cross-Feature Dependencies

Features are designed to work together with clear dependencies and extension points:

- **Lower-tier features** include extension points needed by higher-tier features
- **Higher-tier features** build upon capabilities provided by lower-tier features
- **Consistent terminology** is used across all specifications
- **Error handling patterns** are standardized across features
- **Performance considerations** are addressed at all tiers

For a detailed analysis of feature dependencies, see [DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md](./analysis/DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md).

## How to Use These Specs

- **New Developers**: Start with Tier 1 features to understand the core functionality
- **Feature Development**: Reference the relevant spec before making changes
- **Bug Fixes**: Update specs if implementation changes
- **Code Reviews**: Verify changes against the relevant spec

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Keep specs in sync with implementation
2. Update status when features are completed
3. Add new specs before implementing new features
4. Archive outdated specs rather than deleting them
5. Regularly verify consistency with steering files

## Relationship to Steering Files

These specifications align with and complement the steering files in `.kiro/steering/`:

- **product.md**: Provides product overview and vision
- **tech.md**: Outlines technical stack and approach
- **structure.md**: Defines project structure and patterns
