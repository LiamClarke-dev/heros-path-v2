## Introduction

The Saved Places feature is a core user organization capability that allows users to bookmark and manage discoveries they find interesting during their walks. It transforms the app from a passive discovery tool into an active collection builder, creating lasting value for users. This feature includes place details with photos and reviews, AI-powered place summaries, and integration with the Google Places API for rich content, helping users build a personal collection of favorite locations.
