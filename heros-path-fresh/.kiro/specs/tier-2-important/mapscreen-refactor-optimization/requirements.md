# Requirements Document: MapScreen Refactor & Performance Optimization

## Introduction

The MapScreen Refactor & Performance Optimization feature aims to modularize the large and complex MapScreen.js file, improving maintainability, readability, and performance. The goal is to extract subcomponents, custom hooks, and utility functions, while ensuring that all existing features and user experience remain intact. This will make the codebase easier to extend, debug, and optimize in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MapScreen code to be modular and maintainable, so that it is easier to understand, extend, and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the MapScreen logic SHALL be split into subcomponents, hooks, and utility files.
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN each module SHALL have a clear, single responsibility.
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL be able to understand the MapScreen logic more easily.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the MapScreen to remain performant and responsive, so that my experience is not degraded by the refactor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app THEN the MapScreen SHALL render as quickly as before or faster.
2. WHEN interacting with the map THEN there SHALL be no new lag or stutter introduced by the refactor.
3. WHEN tracking journeys or viewing saved data THEN all features SHALL work as before.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply React and React Native performance best practices, so that unnecessary re-renders and memory usage are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting subcomponents THEN props and state SHALL be managed to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
2. WHEN using functions or objects in render THEN memoization (useMemo/useCallback) SHALL be applied where appropriate.
3. WHEN handling large lists or map markers THEN performance optimizations SHALL be considered (e.g., clustering, virtualization).

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure no regression in user-facing features or UI, so that the refactor is safe to deploy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all existing MapScreen features SHALL be present and function as before.
2. WHEN running tests or manual QA THEN there SHALL be no new bugs or missing features.
3. WHEN reviewing the UI THEN the appearance SHALL match the pre-refactor version.

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases

1. **Complex State Dependencies:** Some state may be shared across multiple subcomponents and hooks; care must be taken to avoid breaking data flow.
2. **Performance Regression:** Extracting components incorrectly could cause more re-renders if not memoized properly.
3. **Platform-Specific Logic:** iOS and Android map handling may require careful separation.

### Technical Constraints

1. **No Feature Regression:** All user-facing features must remain intact.
2. **React Native/Expo Compatibility:** All refactored code must work with the current Expo/React Native setup.
3. **Testing Coverage:** Manual and/or automated tests must be run to ensure no regressions.

### Business Rules

1. **Maintain User Experience:** The refactor must not degrade the user experience.
2. **Code Review Required:** All changes must be reviewed before merging.

## Related Features

- **Map Navigation & GPS (Tier 1):** This refactor directly supports the maintainability of the core map feature.
- **Saved Places, Journey Tracking:** These features depend on MapScreen and will benefit from improved code structure.
