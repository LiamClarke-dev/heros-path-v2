# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Discovery Preferences feature allows users to customize the types of places they discover during walks in the Hero's Path app. This personalization system enables users to filter discoveries based on their interests, ensuring that the app shows relevant places that match their preferences. By providing granular control over place types and quality filters, the feature enhances the overall discovery experience and increases user satisfaction with the app's core functionality.
