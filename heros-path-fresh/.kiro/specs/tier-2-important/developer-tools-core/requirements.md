# Developer Tools (Core) - Requirements

## Overview

Developer Tools (Core) provides essential testing and development utilities that accelerate feature development and debugging. This feature has been reprioritized from Tier 4 to Tier 2 to enable earlier implementation of testing capabilities. This core version focuses on the most critical tools needed for testing Tier 1 and Tier 2 features.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to simulate journeys without walking so I can test discovery algorithms
- I want to simulate location data so I can test GPS-dependent features
- I want to bypass authentication during development so I can focus on feature testing
- I want to inject discovery data so I can test UI components
- I want to monitor API calls and responses so I can debug integration issues
- I want to test offline functionality without losing internet connection

### As a QA Tester
- I want to create reproducible test scenarios so I can verify bug fixes
- I want to simulate different network conditions so I can test error handling
- I want to generate test data quickly so I can test edge cases

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Journey Simulator (Core)

### 5. API Monitoring (Core)
- **FR-DT-018**: Log all API calls and responses
- **FR-DT-019**: Simulate API errors and timeouts
- **FR-DT-020**: Monitor API performance metrics
- **FR-DT-021**: Test API rate limiting scenarios

### 6. Network Simulation (Core)
- **FR-DT-022**: Simulate slow network connections
- **FR-DT-023**: Simulate network disconnection

### 7. Basic Test Scenario Management (Core)
- **FR-DT-026**: Save basic test configurations
- **FR-DT-027**: Load predefined test scenarios
- **FR-DT-028**: Export/import basic test configurations
- **FR-DT-029**: Track test execution results

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-DT-001**: Developer tools should not impact app performance in production builds
- **NFR-DT-002**: Tools should be easily disabled for production releases
- **NFR-DT-003**: Simulation tools should be responsive and not cause UI lag

### Security
- **NFR-DT-004**: Developer tools should only be available in development builds
- **NFR-DT-005**: Authentication bypass should not expose sensitive data
- **NFR-DT-006**: API monitoring should not log sensitive information

### Usability
- **NFR-DT-007**: Tools should be accessible through a developer menu
- **NFR-DT-008**: Configuration should be persistent across app sessions
- **NFR-DT-009**: Tools should provide clear feedback and status indicators

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **User Authentication**: For authentication bypass functionality
- **Map Navigation & GPS**: For location simulation
- **Journey Tracking**: For journey simulation
- **Search Along Route**: For discovery injection

### External Dependencies
- **React Native Debugger**: For enhanced debugging capabilities
- **Flipper**: For network inspection and debugging

## Constraints

- Developer tools must be completely disabled in production builds
- Tools should not interfere with normal app functionality
- Configuration should be easily reset to defaults
- Tools should work offline for testing offline scenarios

## Success Criteria

1. **Development Efficiency**: Reduce time to test new features by 50%
2. **Bug Detection**: Enable early detection of edge cases and errors
3. **Testing Coverage**: Support comprehensive testing of all core features
4. **Developer Experience**: Provide intuitive and reliable testing tools

## Extension Points

### For Tier 4 Advanced Features

## Scope Limitations

This core version focuses on essential testing capabilities and excludes:
- Advanced performance profiling tools
- Database viewer/editor functionality
- Complex test scenario management
- Cross-platform testing utilities
- Advanced analytics integration
- Remote configuration capabilities

These advanced features will be implemented in the Tier 4 version of Developer Tools.
