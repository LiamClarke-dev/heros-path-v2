# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Discovery Consolidation feature is a critical data quality component of the Hero's Path app that intelligently merges discoveries from multiple sources (Search Along Route and Ping results) into a unified, deduplicated set of high-quality points of interest. This feature ensures that users receive a consistent, organized view of discoveries regardless of how they were found, eliminating duplicates and prioritizing the highest quality data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want my discoveries from different sources to be automatically consolidated, so that I don't see duplicate places in my discovery list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a journey is completed THEN the system SHALL merge discoveries from Search Along Route (SAR) and Ping results.
2. WHEN the same place is discovered through multiple sources THEN the system SHALL identify it as a duplicate using place_id.
3. WHEN duplicates are identified THEN the system SHALL merge them into a single discovery record.
4. WHEN a place appears in both SAR and Ping results THEN the system SHALL preserve the source attribution in the merged record.
5. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate place_ids exist in the user's discovery list.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want the highest quality data to be prioritized when merging duplicate discoveries, so that I see the most complete and accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN merging duplicate places THEN the system SHALL prioritize data from the source with more complete information.
2. WHEN merging place ratings THEN the system SHALL use the highest available rating.
3. WHEN merging user rating counts THEN the system SHALL use the highest count available.
4. WHEN merging place types THEN the system SHALL combine all unique types from all sources.
5. WHEN merging address information THEN the system SHALL use the most complete address available.
6. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL track which source provided each piece of information.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want consolidated discoveries to be stored consistently, so that my app experience is seamless regardless of how places were discovered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL store all consolidated discoveries in Firestore with consistent data structure.
2. WHEN storing consolidated discoveries THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the consolidation process.
3. WHEN storing consolidated discoveries THEN the system SHALL preserve source attribution for analytics purposes.
4. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL update journey completion status based on consolidated discoveries.
5. WHEN consolidation fails for any reason THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and log appropriate diagnostics.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path developer, I want the consolidation process to be efficient and reliable, so that users experience minimal delay after completing a journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is triggered THEN the system SHALL process discoveries in an efficient manner.
2. WHEN consolidation is running THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate progress indicators to the user.
3. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide statistics about the consolidation process.
4. WHEN consolidation encounters invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without failing the entire process.
5. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL archive or clean up temporary ping results to maintain database efficiency.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Hero's Path user, I want my consolidated discoveries to be immediately available in the Discoveries screen, so that I can review them right after completing a journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL make consolidated discoveries immediately available in the Discoveries screen.
2. WHEN viewing consolidated discoveries THEN the user SHALL see a consistent presentation regardless of the original source.
3. WHEN a user interacts with consolidated discoveries THEN the system SHALL maintain all standard discovery functionality (save, dismiss, etc.).
4. WHEN a user filters discoveries THEN the system SHALL apply filters consistently to consolidated discoveries.
5. WHEN a journey has consolidated discoveries THEN the system SHALL accurately reflect the journey's completion status based on user interactions with those discoveries.

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Place Data Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want consolidated discoveries to include rich place information, so that I can make informed decisions about places to visit.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN consolidating discoveries THEN the system SHALL integrate popularity scoring and accessibility information
2. WHEN processing place data THEN the system SHALL include amenities and operating hours information
3. WHEN displaying consolidated places THEN the system SHALL show price level indicators and enhanced photos
4. WHEN updating data THEN the system SHALL maintain data freshness and quality tracking
5. WHEN handling enhanced data THEN the system SHALL ensure efficient processing and storage

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization Strategies
**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidation performance to be optimized for large datasets, so that the system can handle growth efficiently.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies
2. WHEN consolidating data THEN the system SHALL use batch processing optimization for efficiency
3. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL handle large datasets without performance degradation
4. WHEN executing algorithms THEN the system SHALL optimize processing speed and resource usage
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive performance metrics

### Requirement 10: Custom Consolidation Algorithms
**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible consolidation logic, so that algorithms can be improved and customized over time.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN consolidating discoveries THEN the system SHALL support configurable consolidation algorithms
2. WHEN detecting duplicates THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scoring and quality assessment
3. WHEN merging data THEN the system SHALL track merge operations and maintain operation history
4. WHEN processing places THEN the system SHALL record algorithm performance and effectiveness metrics
5. WHEN updating algorithms THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data

### Requirement 11: Developer Tools Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing tools for consolidation, so that I can test and debug consolidation workflows effectively.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN testing consolidation THEN the system SHALL provide mock consolidation scenarios and simulation capabilities
2. WHEN debugging algorithms THEN the system SHALL offer duplicate detection testing and algorithm performance comparison
3. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL support large dataset simulation and network condition testing
4. WHEN validating workflows THEN the system SHALL provide configurable discovery datasets and benchmark scenarios
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL offer comprehensive testing and validation utilities
