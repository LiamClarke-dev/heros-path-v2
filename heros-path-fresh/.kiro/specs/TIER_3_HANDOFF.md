## Established Pattern for Updates

Each feature requires updating **3 files** following this **exact pattern**:

### 1. Update `design.md`
- **Add to data models**: Migration framework fields (see template below)
- **Add section before conclusion**: "Dependencies and Extensions" (copy exact format from completed features)

### 2. Update `requirements.md` 
- **Add 4 new requirements**: Requirements 8, 9, 10, 11 
- **Use exact format**: From COORDINATION_GUIDELINES.md extension points for that feature
- **Follow naming**: Use consistent terminology from guidelines

### 3. Update `tasks.md`
- **Add 5 new task groups**: Task Groups 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- **Task Groups 11-14**: Implement the 4 extension points 
- **Task Group 15**: Migration Framework Implementation
- **Reference requirements**: Map tasks to requirements 8-11

## Data Model Template to Add

For any data models found in design.md files, add these fields:

```javascript
// NEW: Migration framework support
schemaVersion: Number,         // Schema version for migration tracking
lastMigrationAt: String,       // Timestamp of last migration
migrationHistory: Array,       // Array of migration records

// NEW: Developer tools support  
devMode: Boolean,              // Whether in developer mode
mockData: Boolean,             // Whether using mock data

// NEW: Performance optimization
lastUpdated: String,           // Last update timestamp
cacheKey: String,              // Cache key for optimization

// NEW: Extension points for future features
metadata: Object,              // Extensible metadata
extensions: Object             // Extension points for future features
```

## Extension Points by Remaining Features

### Destination Routing
From COORDINATION_GUIDELINES.md:
- **Route Planning**: Advanced route planning algorithms
- **Navigation Integration**: Turn-by-turn navigation
- **Performance Optimization**: Route calculation optimization
- **Developer Tools**: Route simulation and testing

### Gamification
From COORDINATION_GUIDELINES.md:
- **Achievement System**: Comprehensive achievement framework
- **Social Features**: Social sharing and competition
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: Gamification data optimization

## File Locations

**Destination Routing:**
- `heros-path-fresh/.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/destination-routing/design.md`
- `heros-path-fresh/.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/destination-routing/requirements.md`
- `heros-path-fresh/.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/destination-routing/tasks.md`

**Gamification:**
- `heros-path-fresh/.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/gamification/design.md`
- `heros-path-fresh/.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/gamification/requirements.md`
- `heros-path-fresh/.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/gamification/tasks.md`

## Quick Reference for Dependencies & Extensions Section

Copy this exact format (update with feature-specific content):

```markdown
## Dependencies and Extensions

### Dependent Features
- [Feature Name](../feature/design.md) - Brief description of dependency

### Extension Points

#### Extension Point Name
Description of extension point capabilities.
- **Used by**: [Feature Name](../feature/design.md)
- **Implementation**: Technical implementation approach
- **Features**: List of specific features and capabilities

[Repeat for each of the 4 extension points]

### Migration Considerations
- **Schema Version**: 2.0
- **Migration Requirements**: Feature-specific migration needs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy support details

### Developer Tools Integration
- **Testing Support**: Testing capabilities description
- **Mock Data Support**: Mock data capabilities
- **Simulation Capabilities**: Simulation features

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Caching approach description
- **Optimization Hooks**: Performance optimization points
- **Performance Considerations**: Performance factors
```

## Requirements Template (8-11)

For each feature, add 4 new requirements following this pattern:

```markdown
### Requirement 8: [Extension Point 1 Name]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [action/behavior].
[... 10 acceptance criteria total]

### Requirement 9: [Extension Point 2 Name]
[... same pattern]

### Requirement 10: [Extension Point 3 Name]
[... same pattern]

### Requirement 11: [Extension Point 4 Name]
[... same pattern]
```

## Tasks Template (11-15)

For each feature, add 5 new task groups:

```markdown
## 11. [Extension Point 1] Implementation

- [ ] 11.1 [Sub-feature 1]
  - [Implementation details]
  - _Requirements: 8.x, 8.y, 8.z_

[... 5 sub-tasks for each extension point]

## 12. [Extension Point 2] Implementation
[... same pattern]

## 13. [Extension Point 3] Implementation
[... same pattern]

## 14. [Extension Point 4] Implementation
[... same pattern]

## 15. Migration Framework Implementation
[... standard migration tasks]
```

## Success Criteria for Completion

You've successfully completed Tier 3 when:
- All 7 Tier 3 features are updated with extension points
- TIER_3_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md shows 7/7 features completed
- All features follow the established patterns from completed features
- Migration framework and developer tools are integrated throughout
- Ready for handoff to Tier 4 agent

## Next Steps After Completion

When all 7 Tier 3 features are complete:

1. **Update TIER_3_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** to show 7/7 completed
2. **Create TIER_3_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md** following the pattern from TIER_1_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md
3. **Update progress tracking** for final status
4. **Prepare handoff to Tier 4 agent** with completed foundation

## Reference Files

- **COORDINATION_GUIDELINES.md** - Contains all extension points and requirements
- **TIER_2_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** - Shows the exact patterns to follow
- **Completed Tier 3 features** - Use as templates for the exact format

## Quality Checklist

Before marking each feature complete:
- [ ] Data models include migration framework fields
- [ ] Dependencies and Extensions section added with correct cross-references
- [ ] 4 new requirements added (8-11) 
- [ ] 5 new task groups added (11-15)
- [ ] Extension points match COORDINATION_GUIDELINES.md exactly
- [ ] Terminology follows guidelines (Journey not route, Discovery not place, etc.)
- [ ] Progress updated in TIER_3_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md

The foundation is solid and the pattern is established - the remaining 2 features should follow the exact same pattern as the 5 completed features.
