# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Authentication feature is a critical foundation for Hero's Path that provides a secure and user-friendly authentication system. It enables users to create accounts, sign in using multiple methods, maintain persistent sessions, and securely access their personalized data. This feature ensures that user journeys, discoveries, and preferences are securely stored and associated with the correct user account, enabling a personalized exploration experience across multiple devices and sessions.

## Requirements

6. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL navigate the user to the main app interface.
7. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the reason for failure.
8. WHEN a user attempts to sign up with an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 2: Session Management

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want my authentication session to persist across app restarts, so that I don't need to sign in every time I use the app.

2. WHEN a user reopens the app after closing it THEN the system SHALL automatically restore their authenticated session.
3. WHEN stored authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate.
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication tokens and user session data.
5. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL check for existing valid authentication tokens before showing the sign-in screen.

### Requirement 3: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my profile to be created and managed automatically, so that my preferences and data are associated with my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a default user profile in Firestore.
2. WHEN a user profile is created THEN the system SHALL include default values for preferences, stats, and other user-specific data.
3. WHEN a user's profile data changes THEN the system SHALL update the Firestore database accordingly.
4. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL load their profile data from Firestore.
5. WHEN profile loading fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide appropriate feedback.

### Requirement 4: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to properly manage authentication state throughout the application, so that protected content is only accessible to authenticated users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide access to protected screens and features.
2. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL restrict access to authentication screens only.
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the navigation structure accordingly.
4. WHEN the app needs to access user-specific data THEN the system SHALL provide the current authentication state and user information.
5. WHEN components need to know if a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent way to check authentication status.

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when authentication issues occur, so that I can resolve them and continue using the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity issues affect authentication THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages.
2. WHEN Firebase authentication services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully.
3. WHEN authentication fails due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages.
4. WHEN authentication fails due to account issues THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate recovery actions.
5. WHEN the app detects authentication token problems THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh tokens or prompt for re-authentication.

### Requirement 6: Security Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication and personal data to be handled securely, so that my information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms.
2. WHEN handling user credentials THEN the system SHALL never store passwords in plain text.
3. WHEN accessing Firestore data THEN the system SHALL enforce Firebase security rules to protect user data.

5. WHEN implementing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL follow OAuth 2.0 standards and best practices.

### Requirement 7: Social Features Foundation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user profile is created THEN the system SHALL include social profile data structure.
2. WHEN social features are enabled THEN the system SHALL support social profile management.
3. WHEN third-party authentication is used THEN the system SHALL support linking multiple accounts.
4. WHEN social sharing is requested THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate privacy controls.
5. WHEN social profile data changes THEN the system SHALL update the profile securely.

### Requirement 8: Developer Tools Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication to support testing and development tools, so that I can efficiently test features without physical requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL support authentication bypass.
2. WHEN mock data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide realistic user profile data.
3. WHEN testing scenarios are simulated THEN the system SHALL support various auth failure modes.
4. WHEN developer tools are active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate dev mode status.
5. WHEN production mode is detected THEN the system SHALL disable all developer features.

### Requirement 9: Data Migration Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to be automatically updated when new features are added, so that I can access new functionality seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects a profile version mismatch THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate the profile.
