# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Background Location Tracking is a critical technical feature that enables GPS tracking to continue when the app is minimized or the screen is locked. This feature is essential for the Hero's Path app as it allows users to track their walks accurately without having to keep the app in the foreground. The implementation handles platform-specific requirements, battery optimization, location permissions, and privacy controls to ensure accurate journey recording while respecting user privacy and device resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Background Location Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want my walks to be tracked even when my phone screen is locked or the app is minimized, so that I can accurately record my complete journey without having to keep the app open.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a walk AND minimizes the app THEN the system SHALL continue tracking the user's location.
2. WHEN the user locks their device screen during a walk THEN the system SHALL continue tracking the user's location.
3. WHEN the app is in the background THEN the system SHALL use a foreground service notification to maintain tracking functionality.
4. WHEN the app returns to the foreground THEN the system SHALL seamlessly continue tracking without data loss.
5. WHEN the user ends a walk THEN the system SHALL stop all background location tracking.

### Requirement 2: Location Permission Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear explanations about location permissions and easy ways to grant them, so that I understand what data is being collected and can easily enable the necessary permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is first launched THEN the system SHALL request foreground location permissions with clear explanations.
2. WHEN the user attempts to start a walk THEN the system SHALL check for and request background location permissions if not already granted.
3. IF background location permissions are not granted THEN the system SHALL display a warning banner with the text "Hero's Path Does Not Have 'Always' Allow Location Access (Tap to resolve)".
4. WHEN the user taps the permission warning banner THEN the system SHALL display a detailed explanation and provide a direct link to device settings.
5. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL immediately hide any warning banners.
6. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to enable them later.

### Requirement 3: Location Data Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tracked routes to be accurate and smooth, so that my journey history reflects my actual path without GPS errors or glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking a walk THEN the system SHALL filter out low-accuracy GPS points to improve route quality.
2. WHEN receiving location updates THEN the system SHALL implement location smoothing to reduce GPS noise and erratic readings.
3. WHEN starting location tracking THEN the system SHALL implement a GPS warm-up mechanism for better initial accuracy.
4. WHEN tracking a walk THEN the system SHALL validate location coordinates to prevent invalid data points.
5. WHEN tracking a walk THEN the system SHALL store location data with timestamp, accuracy, and coordinate information.

### Requirement 4: Battery Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to use battery efficiently during walks, so that tracking my journeys doesn't drain my device battery excessively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking in the background THEN the system SHALL use optimized location request intervals to balance accuracy and battery usage.
2. WHEN tracking a walk THEN the system SHALL use appropriate distance filters to avoid unnecessary updates.
3. WHEN the app is in the foreground THEN the system SHALL use more frequent updates for responsive UI feedback.
4. WHEN the app is in the background THEN the system SHALL reduce update frequency to conserve battery.

### Requirement 5: Privacy Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want transparent information about when and how my location is tracked, so that I feel confident about my privacy when using the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting location permissions THEN the system SHALL clearly explain that location is only tracked during active walks.
2. WHEN displaying permission dialogs THEN the system SHALL emphasize that developers cannot see location in real-time.
3. WHEN requesting permissions THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about data storage practices.
4. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators in the UI.
5. WHEN a walk ends THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all location tracking.

### Requirement 6: Platform-Specific Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work correctly on my specific device (iOS or Android), so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on iOS THEN the system SHALL implement iOS-specific permission flows and background tracking methods.
2. WHEN running on Android THEN the system SHALL implement Android-specific foreground services and notification requirements.
3. WHEN displaying permission instructions THEN the system SHALL show platform-specific guidance.
4. WHEN opening settings THEN the system SHALL direct to the appropriate platform-specific settings page.

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle location errors gracefully, so that my experience isn't disrupted by temporary GPS issues or permission changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location services become unavailable during tracking THEN the system SHALL notify the user and attempt to recover.
2. WHEN permissions are revoked during tracking THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide recovery instructions.
3. WHEN GPS signal is temporarily lost THEN the system SHALL continue tracking and resume normal operation when signal returns.
4. WHEN the app crashes during tracking THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover tracking state on restart.
5. WHEN location data is invalid THEN the system SHALL filter out the invalid points rather than crashing.

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want different tracking modes for various use cases, so that I can optimize tracking for specific scenarios like destination-based navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects destination tracking mode THEN the system SHALL optimize tracking parameters for navigation to a specific location.
2. WHEN the user selects continuous tracking mode THEN the system SHALL use standard tracking parameters for general journey recording.
3. WHEN the user selects optimized tracking mode THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust parameters based on battery level and movement patterns.
4. WHEN switching between tracking modes THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition without data loss.
5. WHEN using destination tracking THEN the system SHALL provide arrival notifications and automatic tracking adjustments.

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced accuracy tracking and street coverage data, so that I can provide better location-based features and route analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking location THEN the system SHALL collect detailed accuracy statistics for quality assessment.
2. WHEN processing location data THEN the system SHALL calculate street coverage percentage for route analysis.
3. WHEN accuracy is poor THEN the system SHALL provide detailed accuracy distribution data for debugging.
4. WHEN tracking is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive accuracy reports for analysis.
5. WHEN street coverage is low THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for improving tracking quality.

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive developer tools for location tracking, so that I can test and debug location features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN testing location features THEN the system SHALL provide tools to simulate various tracking scenarios.
3. WHEN debugging location issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed accuracy statistics and error logs.

5. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL provide tools to simulate different device conditions.

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want location tracking to be optimized for performance and battery efficiency, so that the app can provide reliable tracking without excessive resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL use adaptive optimization based on device capabilities and battery level.
