# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Search Along Route (SAR) is a key differentiator feature for Hero's Path that automatically discovers points of interest along a user's entire walking route, rather than just at a center point. This feature transforms the discovery experience by providing comprehensive coverage of interesting places throughout the journey path, ensuring users don't miss any potential discoveries due to the limitations of center-point searching. By leveraging Google Places API's searchAlongRouteParameters, SAR delivers a more thorough and engaging discovery experience that enhances the app's core value proposition of turning ordinary walks into journeys of discovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to discover places along my entire walking route, so that I don't miss interesting locations that aren't near the center of my journey.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a journey THEN the system SHALL search for places along the entire route path using Google Places API's searchAlongRouteParameters.
2. WHEN performing route discovery THEN the system SHALL convert GPS coordinates to Google's encoded polyline format.
3. WHEN searching along a route THEN the system SHALL make a single API call with the entire route to optimize performance and reduce API costs.
4. WHEN discovering places THEN the system SHALL filter results based on the user's discovery preferences.
5. WHEN displaying discovered places THEN the system SHALL deduplicate results by place_id to prevent showing the same place multiple times.
6. WHEN the route is less than 50 meters in length THEN the system SHALL skip the search along route process.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to fall back to center-point search if Search Along Route fails, so that I still get discoveries even if there's an API issue.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the Search Along Route API call fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to the center-point search method.
2. WHEN falling back to center-point search THEN the system SHALL calculate the center point of the route coordinates.
3. WHEN using center-point fallback THEN the system SHALL search with a 500-meter radius from the center point.
4. WHEN using center-point fallback THEN the system SHALL search for each enabled place type separately.
5. WHEN using center-point fallback THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and fallback operation for debugging purposes.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to efficiently handle all route types, so that I get consistent discovery results regardless of my walking pattern.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encoding the route THEN the system SHALL properly handle straight lines, curves, and complex path patterns.
2. WHEN processing route coordinates THEN the system SHALL validate coordinates to ensure they are within valid latitude/longitude ranges.
3. WHEN handling a route with multiple segments THEN the system SHALL encode the entire route as a single polyline.
4. WHEN processing a route THEN the system SHALL handle routes of varying lengths and complexities.
5. WHEN encoding coordinates THEN the system SHALL follow Google's polyline encoding algorithm specifications.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want discovered places to be properly stored and associated with my journey, so that I can review them later.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN places are discovered THEN the system SHALL persist them to Firestore with proper journey association.
2. WHEN storing discoveries THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the discovery source (SAR vs. center-point).
3. WHEN storing discoveries THEN the system SHALL include place details such as name, type, location, and rating.
4. WHEN a user has previously saved or dismissed a place THEN the system SHALL filter it out from new discovery results.
5. WHEN storing discoveries THEN the system SHALL handle potential duplicates between SAR results and ping-based discoveries.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to optimize the discovery process for performance and battery life, so that the app remains responsive and efficient.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing SAR THEN the system SHALL use a single API call rather than multiple segment calls to minimize API usage.
2. WHEN processing discovery results THEN the system SHALL implement efficient filtering and deduplication algorithms.
3. WHEN handling large routes THEN the system SHALL process coordinates efficiently to avoid performance issues.
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include only necessary fields to reduce data transfer.
5. WHEN discovery operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging without crashing.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to respect my place type preferences when discovering places along my route, so that I only see places that interest me.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing SAR THEN the system SHALL only search for place types that are enabled in the user's discovery preferences.
2. WHEN a user has selected specific place types in DiscoveryPreferencesScreen THEN the system SHALL include only those types in the SAR API request.
3. WHEN a user has selected the 'All Types' option THEN the system SHALL include all supported place types from the PLACE_TYPES constant in the SAR API request.
4. WHEN filtering SAR results THEN the system SHALL respect the user's minimum rating preference.
5. WHEN a user updates their discovery preferences THEN the system SHALL apply these changes to all future SAR operations without requiring app restart.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle place categories intelligently during route discovery, so that I get a diverse and relevant set of discoveries.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing SAR THEN the system SHALL support all place categories defined in PLACE_CATEGORIES (Food & Dining, Shopping & Retail, Entertainment & Culture, Health & Wellness, Services & Utilities, Outdoors & Recreation).
2. WHEN a user has enabled multiple place types within the same category THEN the system SHALL ensure balanced representation of each category in the results.
3. WHEN processing SAR results THEN the system SHALL properly map Google Places API types to the user-friendly labels defined in PLACE_TYPES.
4. WHEN displaying discovered places THEN the system SHALL organize them by their respective categories for better user experience.
5. WHEN a place belongs to multiple categories THEN the system SHALL classify it according to its primary category as defined in the PLACE_TYPES constant.

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to provide intelligent preference-based filtering for discoveries, so that I get personalized and relevant results based on my interests and history.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing SAR THEN the system SHALL integrate with the user's discovery preferences for advanced filtering.
2. WHEN filtering discoveries THEN the system SHALL consider the user's historical preferences and behavior patterns.
3. WHEN processing results THEN the system SHALL apply intelligent ranking based on user preferences and place relevance.
4. WHEN displaying discoveries THEN the system SHALL provide preference-based categorization and organization.
5. WHEN updating preferences THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to ongoing and future discovery operations.
