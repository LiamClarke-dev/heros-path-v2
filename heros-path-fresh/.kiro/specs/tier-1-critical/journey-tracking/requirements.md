# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Journey Tracking & Recording is a core feature of Hero's Path that allows users to record their walking routes with GPS coordinates, visualize their paths in real-time, and save completed journeys for later review. This feature transforms ordinary walks into memorable adventures by tracking routes with glowing polylines, calculating distance and duration metrics, and providing a comprehensive journey completion workflow. The system ensures that journeys and their associated discoveries are properly stored, managed, and accessible for future reference, creating a persistent record of the user's exploration history.

2. WHEN saving a journey THEN the system SHALL store the complete route data with timestamps, distance, and duration.
3. WHEN a journey is saved THEN the system SHALL associate it with the current user's account.
4. WHEN a journey is saved THEN the system SHALL make it available for viewing in the Past Journeys screen.
5. IF the journey is less than 50 meters THEN the system SHALL warn the user that the journey may be too short to save.
6. WHEN saving a journey THEN the system SHALL generate a default name with date and time if the user doesn't provide one.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my past journeys with their routes, statistics, and discoveries, so that I can remember and revisit interesting locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Past Journeys screen THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of all saved journeys.
2. WHEN viewing the journey list THEN the system SHALL display journey metadata including name, date, distance, and duration.
3. WHEN the user selects a past journey THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Discoveries screen for that journey.
4. WHEN viewing the map THEN the system SHALL provide an option to display previously saved routes with a distinct visual style.
5. WHEN displaying past journeys THEN the system SHALL use a visual style that doesn't interfere with the current journey tracking.
6. WHEN a journey is displayed THEN the system SHALL indicate whether its discoveries have been reviewed.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my journey history by deleting unwanted journeys, so that I can keep my history organized and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the journey list THEN the system SHALL provide an option to delete each journey.
2. WHEN the user chooses to delete a journey THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion.
3. WHEN a journey is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data including the route and non-saved discoveries.
4. WHEN a journey with saved discoveries is deleted THEN the system SHALL maintain the saved discoveries but remove their association with the deleted journey.
5. WHEN a journey is deleted THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI components to reflect the deletion.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want journey data to be reliably stored and synchronized, so that I don't lose my walking history and discoveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a journey is saved THEN the system SHALL store it persistently in Firestore.
2. WHEN the app is restarted THEN the system SHALL load all previously saved journeys.
3. WHEN network connectivity is unavailable THEN the system SHALL cache journey data locally until it can be synchronized.
4. WHEN a journey is being recorded THEN the system SHALL periodically save coordinates to prevent data loss in case of app crashes.
5. WHEN the user changes devices THEN the system SHALL make their journey history available on the new device after sign-in.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my journey data to be optimized for performance and battery life, so that I can track long journeys without draining my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL use adaptive location sampling based on movement speed.
2. WHEN the device battery is low THEN the system SHALL reduce location update frequency to conserve power.
3. WHEN displaying large journey routes THEN the system SHALL use route simplification to maintain smooth rendering.
4. WHEN storing journey data THEN the system SHALL use batch processing to minimize database operations.
5. WHEN the app is in the background THEN the system SHALL optimize location tracking for battery efficiency.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate location tracking with proper error handling, so that my journey data is reliable and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPS accuracy is poor THEN the system SHALL filter out low-accuracy coordinates.
2. WHEN location services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user.
3. WHEN tracking is interrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to resume tracking automatically.
4. WHEN location data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL validate and clean the data before storage.
5. WHEN the user moves between different environments THEN the system SHALL adapt tracking parameters accordingly.

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want journey tracking to support extensible metadata and gamification features, so that future features can enhance the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a journey is completed THEN the system SHALL support achievement triggers and progress tracking.
2. WHEN journey data is stored THEN the system SHALL include extensible metadata fields for future features.
3. WHEN route visualization is rendered THEN the system SHALL support custom styling and overlay integration.
4. WHEN journey completion events occur THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for gamification systems.
5. WHEN social sharing features are enabled THEN the system SHALL support journey sharing with privacy controls.

### Requirement 9
