# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Map Navigation & GPS feature is the core functionality of Hero's Path, providing users with an interactive map experience that tracks their walks in real-time with an animated character sprite, displays their route with glowing polylines, and enables discovery of places along their journey. This feature combines Google Maps integration with custom styling, high-precision GPS tracking, background location services, and an engaging visual experience to transform ordinary walks into adventures.

6. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL apply the user's preferred map style.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record my walks with a visually appealing route line, so that I can see where I've been and save my journeys.

4. WHEN a journey is saved THEN the system SHALL store the route data with timestamps, distance, and duration.
5. WHEN viewing the map THEN the system SHALL display previously saved routes with a distinct visual style.
6. IF the journey is less than 50 meters THEN the system SHALL warn the user that the journey may be too short.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want location tracking to continue even when the app is in the background, so that my entire journey is recorded accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app goes to background THEN the system SHALL continue tracking location.
2. WHEN background tracking is active THEN the system SHALL display a notification to inform the user.
3. WHEN the app returns to foreground THEN the system SHALL update the UI with all locations captured while in background.
4. IF background location permission is not granted THEN the system SHALL prompt the user with a clear explanation.
5. WHEN tracking in background THEN the system SHALL optimize for battery usage while maintaining accuracy.
6. WHEN the device is locked THEN the system SHALL continue recording the journey.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the map appearance with different styles, so that I can personalize my experience.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate GPS tracking with filtering for erroneous readings, so that my routes look smooth and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving GPS updates THEN the system SHALL filter out inaccurate readings.
2. WHEN GPS accuracy is poor THEN the system SHALL apply smoothing algorithms to improve route quality.
3. WHEN the app starts tracking THEN the system SHALL implement a GPS warm-up period for better initial accuracy.
4. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL display the current GPS accuracy level to the user.
5. WHEN a GPS reading is rejected THEN the system SHALL log the reason for debugging purposes.
6. WHEN GPS signal improves after being poor THEN the system SHALL adapt and use the improved signal.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see saved places and past journeys on my map, so that I can remember and revisit interesting locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide an option to show/hide saved places.
2. WHEN saved places are enabled THEN the system SHALL display markers for all saved locations.
3. WHEN a saved place marker is tapped THEN the system SHALL display details about that place.
4. WHEN past journeys are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a visual style that doesn't interfere with the current journey tracking.
5. WHEN the user has many saved places THEN the system SHALL implement clustering for better performance.

### Requirement 8
