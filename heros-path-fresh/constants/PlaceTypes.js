/*
 * PLACE TYPES CONSTANTS
 * =====================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This file defines all the different types of places that users can discover during
 * their walks in Hero's Path. It maps Google Places API types to user-friendly labels
 * and provides the foundation for the discovery preferences system. Think of it as
 * the "menu" of what kinds of places users can choose to find during their adventures.
 * 
 * FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Defines mappings between Google Places API types and user-friendly labels
 * - Organizes place types into logical categories (Food & Drink, Shopping, etc.)
 * - Provides the 'key' that matches Google's API requirements exactly
 * - Provides the 'label' that users see in the app interface
 * - Supports an 'all' option for users who want to discover everything
 * - Covers major categories that most users would be interested in discovering
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * The Google Places API uses technical terms like 'meal_takeaway' and 'tourist_attraction'
 * that aren't user-friendly. This file translates those technical terms into readable
 * labels while maintaining the exact API requirements. It also centralizes all place
 * type definitions so they can be consistently used throughout the app.
 * 
 * RELATIONSHIPS:
 * - Used by DiscoveryPreferencesScreen.js to show user preference options
 * - Used by DiscoveriesService.js and PingService.js to filter API results
 * - Used by NewPlacesService.js for making API calls with specific place types
 * - Referenced by any component that needs to display or filter by place types
 * - Connected to user preference storage and filtering systems
 * 
 * REFERENCED BY:
 * - DiscoveryPreferencesScreen.js (for user preference selection)
 * - DiscoveriesService.js (for filtering discovered places)
 * - PingService.js (for real-time discovery filtering)
 * - NewPlacesService.js (for API query construction)
 * - Any screen that displays place type filters or categories
 * 
 * REFERENCES:
 * - Google Places API documentation (for valid place types)
 * - User preference storage systems
 * - Discovery and search algorithms
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APP:
 * Very High - This is foundational to the app's core discovery feature. The types
 * defined here directly determine what users can discover and how the app categorizes
 * places. Changes to this file affect the entire discovery experience and user
 * preferences system.
 * 
 * IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:
 * 1. Add more specific categories - break food into subcategories (Fast Food, Fine Dining, etc.)
 * 2. Add seasonal categories - places relevant to different seasons or holidays
 * 3. Add activity-based grouping - places for specific activities (Date Night, Family Fun, etc.)
 * 4. Add user-customizable categories - let users create their own place type groups
 * 5. Add popularity indicators - show which types are most commonly selected
 * 6. Add location-aware suggestions - recommend relevant types based on current area
 * 7. Add accessibility categories - places with specific accessibility features
 * 8. Add budget-based categories - places grouped by price ranges
 * 9. Add time-based categories - places open early, late, or 24/7
 * 10. Add social categories - places good for groups, couples, or solo visits
 * 11. Add cultural categories - places specific to local culture or international cuisine
 * 12. Add health-conscious categories - healthy food options, fitness-related places
 * 13. Add weather-dependent categories - indoor vs outdoor places
 * 14. Add transportation categories - places accessible by different transport modes
 * 15. Add validation system - ensure all types are still supported by Google Places API
 * 16. Add description field - provide more context about what each category includes
 * 17. Add icon mapping - associate icons with each place type for better UI
 * 18. Add color coding - visual categorization with theme-aware colors
