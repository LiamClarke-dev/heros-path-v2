# Hero's Path - React Native/Expo App

## Project Overview

Hero's Path is a React Native/Expo app that lets users track their walks with a glowing polyline and an animated Link sprite, save past routes for later review, and discover nearby points of interest after each outing. It also includes social sharing of walks and curated "Discoveries," plus user-defined goals to make daily walking more engaging.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL UPDATE: Google Places API Migration**

### ✅ **Migration Status: COMPLETE** (July 2025)
- **Current Branch:** `feature/discovery-preferences-and-map-enhancements`
- **Migration Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - Using Google Places API (New) with automatic fallback
- **Documentation:** See [📚 Documentation Index](docs/README.md) for complete guide

### 🎯 **For API Integration**
**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before working with Google Places API functionality, please read the complete migration documentation in the [docs directory](docs/README.md):

📖 **`GOOGLE_PLACES_API_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Comprehensive guide covering:
- Complete API migration implementation
- Field mappings and response transformations
- AI summaries integration with proper disclosure
- Testing interfaces and troubleshooting
- Backward compatibility and fallback mechanisms

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Route Discovery Algorithm (SAR)**

**🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: FULLY COMPLETE**

The route discovery algorithm in `services/DiscoveriesService.js` now uses **Search Along Route (SAR)** with Google Places API's `searchAlongRouteParameters`. This provides comprehensive discovery along the entire route path.

**✅ What's Working:**
- **Full route coverage**: Searches along the entire GPS polyline, not just center point
- **All route types**: Works with straight lines, curves, long distances, and complex paths
- **Automatic triggering**: Runs when user ends their journey
- **Fallback system**: Gracefully falls back to center-point method if SAR fails
- **Performance optimized**: Single API call per journey with comprehensive results

**Technical Implementation:**
- **`searchAlongRoute()`**: Main SAR function using Google Places API
- **`encodePolyline()`**: Converts GPS coordinates to Google's polyline format
- **`buildSearchQuery()`**: Creates search query from user preferences
- **`getSuggestionsForRouteFallback()`**: Fallback to center-point method if SAR fails

**Impact:**
This transforms the app's core value proposition - users now discover places along their ENTIRE route, not just the center. Works perfectly for all route types and provides comprehensive discovery coverage.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Fully implemented and working in production

### ✅ **Migration Benefits Achieved**
- **Consistent response data** across all endpoints
- **Primary place types** eliminate duplicate detection issues
- **Enhanced features**: AI summaries, dynamic data, improved filtering
- **Better performance** and security (OAuth support)
- **Simplified pricing** with field masking
- **Full backward compatibility** with automatic fallback

### 🔧 **Current API Implementation**
- **Primary Service**: `services/NewPlacesService.js` - Unified API interface
- **Enhanced Service**: `services/EnhancedPlacesService.js` - Advanced features wrapper
- **Discovery Service**: `services/DiscoveriesService.js` - Route-based place suggestions
- **Testing Interface**: Settings screen includes API connectivity testing

### 🚀 **Key Features Working**
- ✅ **AI-powered place summaries** with proper "Summarized with Gemini" disclosure
- ✅ **Editorial summaries** for places without AI content
- ✅ **Automatic fallback** to legacy API when new API unavailable
- ✅ **Field masking** for optimized performance
- ✅ **All place types** compatible with new API
- ✅ **Production-ready** with comprehensive error handling

## 🆕 **UI & Navigation Refactor (July 2025)**

### **Modern, Slim UI**
- All screens now use shared UI primitives: `Card`, `ListItem`, `AppButton`, `SectionHeader`, and `Divider` for a consistent, modern look.
- UI elements are slimmer, with reduced padding, font size, and spacing for a sleeker feel.
- SettingsScreen theme and map style pickers are less squashed and more visually balanced.

### **Navigation Structure**
- Navigation is now modular: Drawer for top-level, Stack for flows, Tab for sub-sections (e.g., Discoveries).
- All navigation logic is in `navigation/AppNavigator.js`.

### **Google Maps API Key Setup (EAS/Expo)**
- **Do NOT hardcode API keys.**
- In `app.json`, reference your iOS key securely:
  ```json
  "ios": {
    // ...
    "config": {
      "googleMapsApiKey": "${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_IOS}"
    }
  }
  ```
- Set `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_IOS` in your EAS dashboard (for cloud builds) or `.env` (for local builds).
- This ensures your key is never committed to source control and is injected at build time.
- See [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variables/) for more info.

## 📋 **Development & Audit Workflow**

### 🔍 **Systematic Code Audit Process**
For new developers joining the project, we have a comprehensive audit workflow:

**📖 `docs/AUDIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`** - Complete step-by-step audit process including:
- **6-Phase Audit System**: Navigation → Services → UI → Screens → Config → Performance
- **Standardized Documentation**: Issue tracking and progress reporting
- **Quick Reference Commands**: Common search patterns and file operations
- **Completion Checklist**: What to verify before considering audit complete

**📊 `docs/AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`** - Current audit status and findings:
- Previous audit results and resolved issues
- Current project status and known problems
- Handover instructions for new developers

### 🎯 **When to Run the Audit**
- After major feature additions
- Before production releases
- When onboarding new developers
- When experiencing unexplained bugs
- Quarterly maintenance

## Git Workflow & Development Strategy

### 🎯 **Optimized Development Workflow**

**Our strategy balances cost control with proper testing:**

#### **When to Use Expo Go (Free, Instant Testing):**
- ✅ **JavaScript logic** (discovery preferences, settings UI)
- ✅ **React Native components** (most UI changes)
- ✅ **AsyncStorage** (saving preferences)
- ✅ **Basic navigation** (drawer, screens)
- ✅ **Firebase integration** (authentication, database)

#### **When to Build Development Version (~$5, Required):**
- 🔄 **Native dependencies** (like `react-native-root-toast`)
- 🔄 **App.js structural changes** (adding wrappers, providers)
- 🔄 **Custom native modules**
- 🔄 **Advanced map features** (new markers, callouts)
- 🔄 **Before merging to main** (final validation)

#### **Branch Strategy:**
```bash
main (stable, ready for production)
├── feature/discovery-preferences-and-map-enhancements (current)
├── feature/social-features
├── feature/advanced-analytics
└── feature/final-polish
```

#### **Development Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Develop JavaScript features in Expo Go
npx expo start
# Test in Expo Go app

# 3. Build when adding native features
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# 4. Test thoroughly in development build

# 5. Merge to main when validated
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main
```

#### **Cost Optimization:**
- **Expo Go testing**: Free, instant iteration
- **Development builds**: Only when needed (~$5 each)
- **TestFlight builds**: Only for final validation (~$10)

### **Branching Best Practices**

#### When to Create Branches:
- ✅ New features (e.g., `feature/user-profiles`, `feature/social-sharing`)
- ✅ Major refactoring (e.g., `refactor/auth-system`)
- ✅ Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/oauth-redirect`)
- ✅ Experimental code that might break things

#### When to Commit to Main:
- ✅ Small bug fixes
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Configuration changes (like environment variables)
- ✅ Minor UI tweaks

#### Branch Naming Convention:
```bash
feature/user-profiles     # New features
fix/oauth-redirect        # Bug fixes
refactor/auth-system      # Code refactoring
docs/readme-update        # Documentation
```

#### Current Status:
- Configuration and environment setup: ✅ Complete (commit to main)
- **Next phase:** Use feature branches for all major feature development
- **Development workflow:** Optimized for cost control and rapid iteration
