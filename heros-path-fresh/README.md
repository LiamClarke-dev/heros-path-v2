# Hero's Path - React Native/Expo App

## Project Overview

Hero's Path is a React Native/Expo app that lets users track their walks with a glowing polyline and an animated Link sprite, save past routes for later review, and discover nearby points of interest after each outing. It also includes social sharing of walks and curated "Discoveries," plus user-defined goals to make daily walking more engaging.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL UPDATE: Google Places API Migration**

### ✅ **Migration Status: COMPLETE** (July 2025)
- **Current Branch:** `feature/discovery-preferences-and-map-enhancements`
- **Migration Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - Using Google Places API (New) with automatic fallback
- **Documentation:** See `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for full details

### 🎯 **For New Developers**
**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before working with Google Places API functionality, please read the complete migration documentation:

📖 **`GOOGLE_PLACES_API_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Comprehensive guide covering:
- Complete API migration implementation
- Field mappings and response transformations
- AI summaries integration with proper disclosure
- Testing interfaces and troubleshooting
- Backward compatibility and fallback mechanisms

### 🚨 **CRITICAL: Route Discovery Algorithm**

**⚠️ DEVELOPMENT NOTE - CORE VALUE FEATURE**

The current route discovery algorithm in `services/DiscoveriesService.js` uses `calculateRouteCenter()` which averages all GPS coordinates to find a single center point. **This is a temporary development solution that fundamentally breaks the app's core value proposition.**

**The Problem:**
- **Straight line routes**: Misses discoveries at the start/end of long walks
- **Long routes**: Only finds places in the middle section
- **Core value failure**: Users should discover places along their ENTIRE route, not just the center

**The Solution Needed:**
- **Path-based search**: Search along the actual route path every 200-500m
- **Route segmentation**: Split long routes into searchable segments
- **Smart radius**: Adjust search radius based on route characteristics

**Impact:**
This is a small piece of code but **CRITICAL** to the app's core value of discovering new places by walking new streets. The current approach only works for small loops and circular routes, failing for the most common use case.

**Priority:** High - This should be implemented when wiring up real functionality, not left as a development shortcut.

### ✅ **Migration Benefits Achieved**
- **Consistent response data** across all endpoints
- **Primary place types** eliminate duplicate detection issues
- **Enhanced features**: AI summaries, dynamic data, improved filtering
- **Better performance** and security (OAuth support)
- **Simplified pricing** with field masking
- **Full backward compatibility** with automatic fallback

### 🔧 **Current API Implementation**
- **Primary Service**: `services/NewPlacesService.js` - Unified API interface
- **Enhanced Service**: `services/EnhancedPlacesService.js` - Advanced features wrapper
- **Discovery Service**: `services/DiscoveriesService.js` - Route-based place suggestions
- **Testing Interface**: Settings screen includes API connectivity testing

### 🚀 **Key Features Working**
- ✅ **AI-powered place summaries** with proper "Summarized with Gemini" disclosure
- ✅ **Editorial summaries** for places without AI content
- ✅ **Automatic fallback** to legacy API when new API unavailable
- ✅ **Field masking** for optimized performance
- ✅ **All place types** compatible with new API
- ✅ **Production-ready** with comprehensive error handling

## 🚀 **Latest Updates (12 July 2025)**

### ✅ **Performance Optimization Complete - VERIFIED WORKING**
- **Smart Caching**: Only make API calls for new journeys or when user explicitly refreshes
- **Existing Journey Detection**: Skip API calls when journey already has discoveries in Firestore
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh functionality for syncing UI state with database
- **Optimized Undo Operations**: Undo dismiss/save operations no longer trigger API calls
- **API Call Reduction**: ~95% reduction in API calls for journey reviews
- **✅ VERIFIED**: New journeys load with 18 API calls, old journeys load with 0 API calls

### ✅ **Real-Time Journey Status Tracking - VERIFIED WORKING**
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Journey completion status updates immediately when discoveries change
- **Completion Percentage**: Tracks percentage of reviewed discoveries per journey
- **UI Status Indicators**: PastJourneysScreen shows "Review" vs "✅ All Reviewed" status
- **Consistent Data**: Discovery records stay in sync with dismissed/saved collections
- **✅ VERIFIED**: Journey status updates in real-time with proper completion tracking

### ✅ **Comprehensive Debug Logging System - VERIFIED WORKING**
- **Centralized Logger**: `utils/Logger.js` provides consistent logging across the app
- **Multiple Log Levels**: Debug, Error, Warning, Info, Performance, API, Journey, Discovery, Cache
- **Easy Production Cleanup**: Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` to disable all debug logs
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in performance monitoring for key operations
- **✅ VERIFIED**: Detailed logs show successful API calls, journey loading, and status updates

### ✅ **Improved Data Management - VERIFIED WORKING**
- **Comprehensive Journey Deletion**: Deletes journey and all associated data (discoveries, dismissed places)
- **Soft Delete Option**: Available for future implementation if needed
- **Development Utilities**: "Delete All Journeys" button for clean slate during development
- **No Orphaned Data**: Ensures complete cleanup when deleting journeys
- **✅ VERIFIED**: Journey deletion works with full data cleanup

### ✅ **Data Consistency Fixes - VERIFIED WORKING**
- **Discovery Record Updates**: Undo operations properly update original discovery records
- **Journey Status Logic**: Zero discoveries correctly marked as complete
- **UI State Synchronization**: All screens stay in sync with Firestore data
- **✅ VERIFIED**: Undo operations restore places to suggestions, journey status updates correctly

## Git Workflow & Development Strategy

### 🎯 **Optimized Development Workflow**

**Our strategy balances cost control with proper testing:**

#### **When to Use Expo Go (Free, Instant Testing):**
- ✅ **JavaScript logic** (discovery preferences, settings UI)
- ✅ **React Native components** (most UI changes)
- ✅ **AsyncStorage** (saving preferences)
- ✅ **Basic navigation** (drawer, screens)
- ✅ **Firebase integration** (authentication, database)

#### **When to Build Development Version (~$5, Required):**
- 🔄 **Native dependencies** (like `react-native-root-toast`)
- 🔄 **App.js structural changes** (adding wrappers, providers)
- 🔄 **Custom native modules**
- 🔄 **Advanced map features** (new markers, callouts)
- 🔄 **Before merging to main** (final validation)

#### **Branch Strategy:**
```bash
main (stable, ready for production)
├── feature/discovery-preferences-and-map-enhancements (current)
├── feature/social-features
├── feature/advanced-analytics
└── feature/final-polish
```

#### **Development Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Develop JavaScript features in Expo Go
npx expo start
# Test in Expo Go app

# 3. Build when adding native features
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# 4. Test thoroughly in development build

# 5. Merge to main when validated
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main
```

#### **Cost Optimization:**
- **Expo Go testing**: Free, instant iteration
- **Development builds**: Only when needed (~$5 each)
- **TestFlight builds**: Only for final validation (~$10)

### **Branching Best Practices**

#### When to Create Branches:
- ✅ New features (e.g., `feature/user-profiles`, `feature/social-sharing`)
- ✅ Major refactoring (e.g., `refactor/auth-system`)
- ✅ Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/oauth-redirect`)
- ✅ Experimental code that might break things

#### When to Commit to Main:
- ✅ Small bug fixes
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Configuration changes (like environment variables)
- ✅ Minor UI tweaks

#### Branch Naming Convention:
```bash
feature/user-profiles     # New features
fix/oauth-redirect        # Bug fixes
refactor/auth-system      # Code refactoring
docs/readme-update        # Documentation
```

#### Current Status:
- Configuration and environment setup: ✅ Complete (commit to main)
- **Next phase:** Use feature branches for all major feature development
- **Development workflow:** Optimized for cost control and rapid iteration
